In a phrase: Speech pathologist turned data scientist. I wrangle data, crunch
numbers, plot pictures, and fit models to study how children 
learn to speak and communicate.

I earned my Ph.D. in communication sciences and disorders in Madison, Wisconsin.
On paper, I was studying speech development, word recognition and word learning
in preschoolers, but over the course of my graduate training, I discovered that
I really, *really* like programming and working with data. I get endless
satisfaction from making computers do things and from solving technical
problems. Functional programming makes me feel like a literal wizard. I love
sharing my enthusiasm with others: Sitting down with a colleague and their
dataset and coaching them through ways to analyze their data in R. Nothing feels
better than giving someone that moment of feeling like a wizard.


Here are some things I might write about here:

* R
* Mixed effects models
* Bayesian statistics
* How to plot certain kinds of data
* Functional programming
* Reproducible computing
* Whatever other little thing I have learned to do recently
