Darren Dahly, username [@statsepi](https://twitter.com/statsepi), asked
people on Twitter to share some of their favorite or least favorite data
visualizations from the pandemic. I nominated the notorious ["cubic fit"
'forecast'](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouseCEA45/status/1257680258364555264)
from the Council of Economic Advisers. But then there was the reply
by Travis Whitfill, username
[@twhitfill](https://twitter.com/twhitfill), showing a nightmare of a
figure from a report produced by Morgan Stanley:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‚Äôd like to submit this one from Morgan Stanley ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/D5CYi6zSrT">pic.twitter.com/D5CYi6zSrT</a></p>
  <img src="/assets/images/2022-03-morgan-stanley.jpg" alt="A two panel plot showing the current number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds in 'closed' versus 'open' states." />
  <br/>
&mdash; Travis Whitfill MPH (@twhitfill) <a href="https://twitter.com/twhitfill/status/1505974833217437696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2022</a></blockquote> 

The main statistical problem here is the completely inappropriate
"smoothing" line. The panel on the left is really two linear trends: a
steady trend around 8,500 patients until May 6th and a decreasing trend
from 11,000 patients starting on May 7th. Upon seeing data like these
points, I would be inclined to ask, "What changed in the data? Was a new
state added to the dataset? Did the definition of what counts as an ICU
bed change?" The analysts here instead imposed a linear trend on the
points.

Another problem with this plot is rhetorical: it's tryhard
counterintuitive bullshit. I think analysts will fetishize surprising or
counterintuitive findings, with an attitude of "oh, you would think that
such-and-such is true but the data show us that *actually* the opposite
is true". At the time of this plot, our belief was something like
"Covid-19 protections like stay-at-home orders can help flatten the curve
and reduce the spread of the disease and the number of
hospitalizations." This plot sashays into the room and tells us "well,
according to the data, it's the states without Covid-19 protections that have
decreasing numbers of ICU patients, and get this: Covid lockdowns make things
worse!". Granted, I could not find the original report for this
image, so I don't know how the authors interpreted it in the report's
narrative. Yet, I can only assume the authors added these linear trend
lines--overriding the default GAM or LOESS smooth used by
[`stat_smooth()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html)--to make this particular point.


When I first saw it, this plot [made me
quip](https://twitter.com/tjmahr/status/1506019955661234184): "I hate
statistics now. it‚Äôs been a good run. gonna live my days out as a
druid". But it's been a few days, and I'm still haunted by this plot.
What did go wrong? Why do the ICU counts shoot upwards like that? So, I
investigated it.


## Attempt 1: There is no jump

I tried to find the original report, searching Google and Twitter for a
report with this image from around May 12, 2020 (when @twhitfill [first
shared it](https://twitter.com/twhitfill/status/1263119423847661569)),
but nothing came up. After dredging through a bunch of Morgan Stanley
report PDFs, I noticed that the reports usually had a small number of
authors, so I am wondering whether (and hoping that) the original report
was something more akin to a dashed-off newsletter than a research
report.

Failing to find the original image, I tried to recreate it in R. The
original image credits The COVID Tracking Project, and [their downloads
page](https://covidtracking.com/data/download) provides a .csv file with
state-level data. Here we read in just the relevant columns, filter down
to the time range of the cursed image, and plot the total number of
current ICU patients.


```r
library(tidyverse)

# a helper function to download the data from github
# in case you want to play along
path_blog_data <- function(x) {
  file.path(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com",
    "tjmahr/tjmahr.github.io/master/_R/data",
    x
  )
}

data <- readr::read_csv(
  path_blog_data("all-states-history.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(
    date = col_date(), 
    state = col_character(), 
    inIcuCurrently = col_number(), 
    .default = col_skip()
  ), 
  progress = FALSE
)

data <- data %>% 
  filter(
    as.Date("2020-04-28") <= date,
    date <= as.Date("2020-05-11")
  )

ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date, y = inIcuCurrently) + 
  stat_summary(fun = "sum", geom = "point", size = 3) +
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Current patients in ICU",
    caption = "Data from The COVID Project (March 23, 2022)"
  ) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 16)
#> Warning: Removed 454 rows containing non-finite values (stat_summary).
```

The numbers steadily decrease from around 14,000 to 12,000." alt="A plot showing the total number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds from April 28, 2020 to May 11, 2020. The numbers steadily decrease from around 14,000 to 12,000." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

There is no jump in ICU patients ‚ùå, and because the jump disappeared
when we used a more recent (and presumably better) version of the
dataset, the jump was probably some kind of artifact. 

Out of curiosity, let's look at the state-by-state data. Because
(*spoiler alert*) about half the states only have `NA` values for this
time period, we will filter out the `NA` points and look at the
remaining points.


```r
ggplot(data %>% filter(!is.na(inIcuCurrently))) + 
  aes(x = date, y = inIcuCurrently) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("state") +
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Current patients in ICU",
    caption = "Data from The COVID Project (March 23, 2022)"
  ) +   
  theme_grey(base_size = 12)
```

<img src="/figs/2022-03-23-morgan-stanley-cursed-covid-plot/most-recent-state-1.png" title="A plot showing the current number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds in states with available data (around 30)." alt="A plot showing the current number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds in states with available data (around 30)." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

So, some states have ICU patient data added midway through this window and
many states are completely missing data from this window. The whole
open-versus-closed-states question was doomed from the get-go because we
don't know what happened in every state.


## Attempt 2: Let's go back in time

If we poke around the COVID Tracking Project's GitHub repository, we
find a [folder of data
backups](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/tree/master/data)
with a file called `states_daily_4pm_et.csv`. This file provides the
same result as the previously loaded data.


```r
data <- readr::read_csv(
  path_blog_data("states_daily_4pm_et.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(
    date = col_date("%Y%m%d"),
    state = col_character(),
    inIcuCurrently = col_number(),
    .default = col_skip()
  ),
  progress = FALSE
)

data <- data %>% 
  filter(
    as.Date("2020-04-28") <= date,
    date <= as.Date("2020-05-11")
  )

ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date, y = inIcuCurrently) + 
  stat_summary(fun = "sum", geom = "point", size = 3) +
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Current patients in ICU",
    caption = "Data from The COVID Project (March 23, 2022)"
  ) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 16)
#> Warning: Removed 454 rows containing non-finite values (stat_summary).
```

<img src="/figs/2022-03-23-morgan-stanley-cursed-covid-plot/latest-total-1.png" title="A plot showing the total number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds from April 28, 2020 to May 11, 2020.

The numbers steadily decrease from around 14,000 to 12,000." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

But because this file is hosted on GitHub, we can go back in time and find
the [version of the data from
May 12, 2020](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/5ec9962d5f5f6505bb0593df150ab62867af98f7/data/states_daily_4pm_et.csv)
and use that file instead.


```r
data <- readr::read_csv(
  path_blog_data("2020-05-12-states_daily_4pm_et.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(
    date = col_date("%Y%m%d"),
    state = col_character(),
    inIcuCurrently = col_number(),
    .default = col_skip()
  ),
  progress = FALSE
)

data <- data %>% 
  filter(
    as.Date("2020-04-28") <= date,
    date <= as.Date("2020-05-11")
  )

ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date, y = inIcuCurrently) + 
  stat_summary(fun = "sum", geom = "point", size = 3) +
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Current patients in ICU",
    caption = "Data from The COVID19 Project (May 12, 2020)"
  ) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 16)
#> Warning: Removed 477 rows containing non-finite values (stat_summary).
```

<img src="/figs/2022-03-23-morgan-stanley-cursed-covid-plot/old-total-1.png" title="A plot showing the total number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds from April 28, 2020 to May 11, 2020.

There it is: the jump ICU patients on May 7th ‚úîÔ∏è. Let's look at the
state-by-state data:


```r
ggplot(data %>% filter(!is.na(inIcuCurrently))) + 
  aes(x = date, y = inIcuCurrently) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("state") +
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Current patients in ICU",
    caption = "Data from The COVID Project (May 12, 2020)"
  ) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 12)
```

<img src="/figs/2022-03-23-morgan-stanley-cursed-covid-plot/old-state-1.png" title="A plot showing the current number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds in states with available data (around 25). Of note is the New York which only has 5 points and they are all above 2000." alt="A plot showing the current number of Covid-19 patients in ICU beds in states with available data (around 25). Of note is the New York which only has 5 points and they are all above 2000." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Look at New York (NY)! That's the jump in original plot. New York had a
large number of ICU patients but their data only became available on
May 7th, giving the spurious increase in ICU patients.

By adding incomplete data from NY to the rest of the states, the analyst
effectively treated all of the missing points in the NY panel as zeros.  

## What could they have done differently?

It's fun to complain about haunted plots, but I will try to be
constructive for a moment. How would a fixed version of this plot look?

**Option 1: Don't do it.** Given all the missing and incomplete data,
it's just not worth it to make this plot.

**Option 2: Don't aggregate.** Or we might embrace the missingness, and
show all and only the data we have. Here is a sketch of this kind of
approach. We will show individual state data and provide labels for the
states that stand out from the pack. We will also note the number of
missing lines in the caption.


```r
data_for_plot <- data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(inIcuCurrently)) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(state_icu_max = max(inIcuCurrently)) %>% 
  ungroup() 

total_regions <- data$state %>% unique() %>% length()
plotted_regions <- data_for_plot$state %>% unique() %>% length()

ggplot(data_for_plot) + 
  aes(x = date, y = inIcuCurrently) + 
  geomtextpath::geom_textline(
    aes(label = state, group = state, hjust = state),
    data = . %>% filter(state_icu_max > 250)
  ) +
  geomtextpath::scale_hjust_discrete() +
  geom_line(
    aes(group = state),
    data = . %>% filter(state_icu_max <= 250)) +
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Current patients in ICU",
    caption = glue::glue(
      "
      Data from The COVID Project (May 12, 2020).
      No data available for {total_regions - plotted_regions} states/territories.
      "
    )
  ) + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 14)
```

<img src="/figs/2022-03-23-morgan-stanley-cursed-covid-plot/try-to-fix-it-1.png" title="An attempt to fix the plot that uses the bad data. It shows one line per included state.

And then we can put the linear regression "smooth" on it. üôÉ

## Update: Notes from the Tracking Project trenches [_Mar. 24, 2022_]

The fact they had to pull numbers from the graphs in the Governor's
Covid briefings is an important reminder that high-quality Covid-19 was
hard to come by at the start of the pandemic ([especially from the Cuomo
administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/nyregion/nursing-home-deaths-cuomo-covid.html)).
We needed something like the COVID Tracking Project where volunteers
would go to heroic lengths to curate data.
