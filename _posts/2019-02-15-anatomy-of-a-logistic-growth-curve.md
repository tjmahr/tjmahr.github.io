In this post, I walk through the code I used to make a nice diagram illustrating
the parameters in a logistic growth curve. I made this figure for a conference
submission. I had a tight word limit (600 words) and a complicated
statistical method (Bayesian nonlinear mixed effects beta regression), so I
wanted to use a diagram to carry some of the expository load. Also, figures
didn't count towards the word limit, so that was a bonus ðŸ˜€.

I will cover a few different topics:

- The pieces of the three-parameter logistic curve
- What the murky "scale" parameter does in the curve
- How to use `plotmath` to add mathematical copy to a plot



## Growth towards a ceiling

<!-- In September, I started a job as a data scientist for an NIH project studying how -->
<!-- speech, language and communication development in children with cerebral palsy. -->
<!-- My title says assistant scientist, but I call myself a data scientist because I -->
<!-- still do all my work in RStudio and because it makes feel cool. And I study -->
<!-- development -->


Children can be hard to understand; they are learning to talk after all. You
probably can imagine a four-year-old politely asking for something:
"pwetty pwease". This understandability problem is compounded for children with
cerebral palsy, because these kids will often have speech-motor impairments on
top of the usual developmental patterns. My current project is a statistical
model of how *intelligibility*---the probability that an unfamiliar listener
understands what a child says---develops from age 3 to age 8 in children with 
cerebral palsy. 

As an example, the R code below plots some (simulated) data for a
single child. They visited our lab 6 times, so we have intelligibility measures
for each of those visits.

One of the interesting features of speech development is that it finishes:
Children stop making the usual developmental speech patterns and converge on a
mature level of performance. They will, no doubt, continue grow and change
through adolescence, but when it comes to making speech sounds accurately and
reliably, most of the developmental change is done by age 8.

For the statistical models, therefore, we expected children to follow a certain
developmental trajectory towards a ceiling: Begin at zero intelligibility,
show a period of accelerating then decelerating growth, and finally plateau at
some mature level of ability. This pattern of growth can be modelled using a
logistic growth curve using three parameters: an asymptote at the ceiling, a
midpoint when growth is steepest, and a scale which sets the slope of the
curve.[^other-terms] Below is the equation of the logistic growth curve:

$$f(t) = \frac{\text{asymptote}}{1 + \exp{((\text{mid}~-~t)~*~\text{scale})}}$$

But this equation doesn't do us any good. If you are like me, you probably
stopped paying attention when you saw exp() in the denominator. Here's the
logistic curve plotted for these data.


```r
xs <- seq(0, 96, length.out = 80)

# Create the curve from the equation parameters
trend <- tibble(
  age = xs,
  asymptote = .8,
  scale = .2,
  midpoint = 48,
  prop = asymptote / (1 + exp((midpoint - age) * scale)))

ggplot(points) + 
  aes(x = age, y = prop) + 
  geom_line(data = trend, color = colors$fit) +
  geom_point(size = 3.5, color = colors$data) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "Age in months", 
    limits = c(0, 96), 
    breaks = scales::extended_breaks(Q = c(24, 12))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Intelligibility",
    limits = c(0, NA),
    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

Now, let's add some labels to mark some key parts of the equation. One
unfamiliar bit of ggplot technology here might be `annotate()`. Geometry
functions like `geom_point()` or `geom_text()` are used to draw data that lives
in a dataframe by using the aesthetic mappings defined in `aes()`. For example,
in the plot above, `aes(x = age)` says *get the* x *position for this geometry
from the `age` column*. These functions draw some geometry (like a point or a
label) for each row of the data.

But we don't have rows and rows of data to draw for an annotation. `annotate()`
is meant to handle these one-off annotations, and we set the aesthetics manually
instead of pulling them from some data. The first argument of `annotate()` says
what kind of geom to use for the annotation: for example, `"text"` calls on
`geom_text()` and `"segment"` calls on `geom_segment()`. The other arguments set
the aesthetics for that geometry.


```r
colors$asym <- "#E7552C"
colors$mid <- "#3B7B9E"
colors$scale <- "#1FA35C"

p <- ggplot(points) +
  aes(x = age, y = prop) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    color = colors$mid,
    x = 48, xend = 48,
    y = 0, yend = .4,
    linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    color = colors$asym,
    x = 20, xend = Inf,
    y = .8, yend = .8,
    linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = trend, size = 1, color = colors$fit) +
  geom_point(size = 3.5, color = colors$data) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "growth plateaus at asymptote",
    x = 20, y = .84,
    # horizontal justification = 0 sets x position to left edge of text
    hjust = 0,
    color = colors$asym) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "growth steepest at midpoint",
    x = 49, y = .05,
    hjust = 0,
    color = colors$mid) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "Age in months", 
    limits = c(0, 96), 
    breaks = scales::extended_breaks(Q = c(24, 12))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Intelligibility",
    limits = c(0, NA),
    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))

p
```

Okay, that just leaves the scale parameter. 

## We need to talk about the scale parameter for a second

In a sentence, the scale parameter controls how steep the curve is. The logistic
curve is at its steepest at the midpoint. Growth accelerates, hits the midpoint,
then decelerates. The rate of change on the curve is changing constantly along
the course of the curve. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to talk about the
scale as the growth rate or as the slope in any particular location. It's better
to think of it as a growth factor, or umm, *scale*. I say that it "controls" the
slope of the curve, because changing the scale will affect the overall steepness
of the curve.

Here is the derivative of the logistic curve. This function tells you the rate
of change in the curve at any point.

$$\frac{d}{dt}f(t) =  \text{asymptote} * \frac{ \text{scale} * \exp{((\text{mid}~-~t)~*~\text{scale})}}{(1 + \exp{((\text{mid}~-~t)~*~\text{scale})})^2}$$

Yeah, I don't like it either, but I have to show you this mess to show how neat
things are at the midpoint of the curve. When *t* is the midpoint, algebraic
magic happens ðŸŽ†. All of the (mid âˆ’ *t*) parts become 0, exp(0) is 1, so everything
simplifies a great deal. Check it out.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}f(t = \text{mid}) &=  \text{asymptote} * \frac{ \text{scale} * \exp{(0~*~\text{scale})}}{(1 + \exp{(0~*~\text{scale}}))^2} \\
&= \text{asymptote} * \frac{ \text{scale} * 1}{(1 + 1)^2} \\
&= \text{asymptote} * \frac{ \text{scale}}{4} \\
\text{slope at midpoint} &= \text{asymptote} * \frac{ \text{scale}}{4} \\
\end{align}
$$

In our case, with a scale of .2 and asymptote of .8, the slope at the 48-month
midpoint is (.2 / 4) \* 8 which is .04. When the curve is at its steepest, for
the data illustrated here, intelligibility grows at a rate of 4 percentage
points per month. That's an upper limit on growth rate: This child never gains
more than 4 percentage points per month.[^reparameter] 

Now, we can add annotate the plot with an arrow with this slope at the midpoint.
That seems like a good representation because this point is where the scale is
most transparently related to the curve's shape.


```r
# Compute endpoints for segment with given slope in middle
slope <- (.2 / 4) * .8
x_step <- 2.5
y1 <- .4 + slope * -x_step
y2 <- .4 + slope * x_step

p <- p +
  geom_segment(
    x = 48 - x_step, xend = 48 + x_step,
    y = y1, yend = y2,
    size = 1.2,
    color = colors$scale,
    arrow = arrow(ends = "both", length = unit(.1, "in"))) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "scale controls slope of curve",
    x = 49, y = .38, 
    color = colors$scale, hjust = 0)
p
```

## Adding the equation

For my conference submission, I didn't want to include the equation in the text.
It was just too low-level of a detail for the 600-word limit. So I added the
equation to the plot using [`plotmath`][plotmath]. I'm not exactly sure what
this feature should be called, but `?plotmath` is what you type to open the help
page, so that's what I call it. You can add math to a plot by providing an
`expression()` which is parsed into mathematical copy, or by passing a string
and setting `parse = TRUE`. Here is a demo of both approaches.


```r
ggplot(tibble(x = 1:3)) + 
  aes(x = x) +
  geom_text(
    aes(y = 1),
    label = expression(1 + 100 + pi)) +
  geom_text(
    aes(y = .5), 
    label = "frac(mu, 100)", 
    parse = TRUE) + 
  xlim(0, 4) + 
  ylim(0, 1.1)
#> Warning in is.na(x): is.na() applied to non-(list or vector) of type
#> 'expression'

# (I don't know what this warning is about.)
```

<img src="/figs/2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/plotmath-demo-1.png" title="Demo of plotmath" alt="Demo of plotmath" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For this plot, we're going to create a helper function that pre-sets `parse` to
`TRUE` and pre-sets the location for the equation.


```r
# Helper to plot an equation in a pre-set spot
annotate_eq <- function(label, ...) {
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = .6, label = label, parse = TRUE, 
           hjust = 0, size = 4, ...)
}
```

Then we just add the equation to the plot.


```r
p + annotate_eq(
    label = "f(t)==frac(asymptote, 1 + exp((mid-t)%*%scale))", 
    color = colors$fit)
```

<img src="/figs/2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq1-1.png" title="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it." alt="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is a perfectly serviceable plot, but we can get fancier. I gave the
parameter annotations different colors for a reason ðŸ˜‰.

### Phantom menaces

Plotmath provides a function called `phantom()` for adding placeholders to
an equation. `phantom(x)` will make space for *x* in the equation but it
won't draw it. Therefore, we can `phantom()` out all of the parameters to draw
the non-parameter parts of the equation in black.


```r
p1 <- p +
  annotate_eq(
    label = "
    f(t) == frac(
      phantom(asymptote), 
      1 + exp((phantom(mid) - t) %*% phantom(scale))
    )",
    color = colors$fit) 
p1
```

<img src="/figs/2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq2a-1.png" title="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it, except there are blanks for 'asymptote', 'mid', and 'scale'." alt="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it, except there are blanks for 'asymptote', 'mid', and 'scale'." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Then we layer on the other parts of the equation in different colors, using
`phantom()` as needed so we don't overwrite the black parts. We also use
`atop()`; it does the same thing as `frac()` except it doesn't draw a fraction
line. Here's the addition of the asymptote.


```r
p2 <- p1 + 
  annotate_eq(
    label = "
    phantom(f(t) == symbol('')) ~ atop(
      asymptote, 
      phantom(1 + exp((mid-t) %*% scale))
    )",
    color = colors$asym)
p2
```

<img src="/figs/2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq2b-1.png" title="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it, except there are blanks for 'mid', and 'scale'. 'Asymptote' is in equation in color." alt="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it, except there are blanks for 'mid', and 'scale'. 'Asymptote' is in equation in color." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

But the other parameters are not that simple. The plotmath help page states that
"A mathematical expression must obey the normal rules of syntax for any R
expression". That warning means that we can't do something like 
`phantom(1 + ) x"` because the ` 1 +  ` is not valid R syntax. So to blank out
parts of expressions, we create expressions using `paste()` to put symbols next
to each other and `symbol()` to refer to symbols/operators as characters.

I have to be honest, however: it took a lot of fiddling to get this work right.
Therefore, I have added the following disclaimer: ðŸš¨ *Don't study this code.
Just observe what is possible, but observe all the hacky code required.* ðŸš¨ 


```r
p2 +
  annotate_eq(
    label = "
    phantom(f(t) == symbol('')) ~ atop(
      phantom(asymptote), 
      phantom(1 + exp((mid-t) * symbol(''))) ~ scale
    )",
    color = colors$scale) +
  annotate_eq(
    label = "
    phantom(f(t) == symbol('')) ~ atop(
      phantom(asymptote), 
      paste(
        phantom(paste(1 + exp, symbol(')'), symbol(')'))),
        mid,
        phantom(paste(symbol('-'), t, symbol(')') * scale))
      )
    )",
    color = colors$mid)
```

<img src="/figs/2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq2c-1.png" title="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it. All three parameters appear in color in the equation." alt="Labelled plot from earlier with an equation added to it. All three parameters appear in color in the equation." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

There we have it---my wonderful, colorful diagram! Take *that* word count! 

In future posts, I will start to write about how I go about actually modelling
data using this growth curve. This post will serve as a basic reference for how
the parameters in the logistic growth curve relate to its shape.

By the way, if you know a better way to plot partially colorized math equations
or how to blank out subexpressions in an easier way, I would love to hear it.

[^other-terms]: By the way, some other ways to describe the asymptote besides 
    "ceiling" or "plateau" would be "saturation" which emphasizes how things 
    only change a small amount near the asymptote or as a "limiting" factor 
    or "capacity" which emphasizes how growth is no longer tenable after a
    certain point. The capacity language comes from the curve's use in 
    population growth. In fact, one of the sites that syndicate my blogposts, 
    weirdly attached [a population growth diagram][r-craft] to my post.
    
    Another note: You don't have to assume that one of the asymptotes starts
    at 0. There is a four-parameter version of the curve that estimates the 
    other asymptote.

[^reparameter]: We could reparameterize the equation to multiply *scale* by
    *4 / asymptote*, so that the scale parameter comes out to be the slope at 
    the midpoint automatically. If you are using a non-Bayesian procedure and 
    want a confidence interval on the slope at the midpoint, then that 
    parameterization should provide an easy way to do that. I prefer using 
    smaller equations here.
