One of the things I have come to appreciate is how programming is a great way to
learn statistics. My eyes will glaze over at a series of equations in a
derivation, but ask me to program the procedure and I'll never forget how it works.
This post will be one of those exercises where we program a statistical tool---a
Q-Q plot (plus its friend the worm plot)---from scratch as a learning exercise.

A quantile-quantile plot---more commonly, a "Q-Q plot", or
more descriptively, a "quantile comparison plot"---is a way to compare two
distributions of data. These plots are a common diagnostic tool when we need to
check a distributional assumption. For example, residual errors from a linear
regression model should normally distributed, and indeed, one of the premade
diagnostic plots for an `lm()` model is Q-Q plot of the residual errors.


```r
plot(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars), which = 2, id.n = 0)
```

Reading these plots is a bit of an art, but Sean Kross provides [a tutorial on
how to interpret these plots][skqq] and walks through diagnostic examples
of "bad" Q-Q plots for skewed or fat-tailed distributions.

In this post, we are going to make Q-Q plots from scratch. My motivation for
this post are a couple of recent cases where I had to manually create Q-Q plots
for [models where the distribution is estimated from the
data][gldrm] and had to create [worm plots, an alternative to the Q-Q
plot][wp]. During this process I discovered that I misunderstood what is
shown on the conventional Q-Q plot, and I feel like I need to document what
these plots are really showing.


**Update: Q-Q plots avant la lettre.** Originally, this post in its header image
attributed the first Q-Q plots to [Hazen
(1914)](https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/shed/lund/Classes/Hazen1914.pdf), but a
reader sent [a French Wikipedia
article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droite_de_Henry) that attributes Q-Q
plots to P. J. P. Henri in the 1880s. [*Sept. 4, 2020*]
{: .notice--info}


## The Q-Q points are easy to calculate

Fox's [regression textbook][fox] (2016, p. 38--39) provides a step-by-step
procedure for building a Q-Q plot and includes a great implementation in the
book's companion R package with [`car::qqPlot()`][carqq]. His procedure will be the
basis for the math in this post

The first step is to convert ranks into quantiles. One naive approach might be
dividing ranks by the length:


```r
# generate data for this post
set.seed(20200825)
x <- sort(rnorm(20, 10, 3))

# naive quantiles
rank(x) / length(x)
#>  [1] 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75
#> [16] 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00
```

With 20 observations, 1 point is 5% of the data, so the quantiles increase by
.05 with each step from .05 to 1.00. The problem here is that we get a quantile
of 1. When we look up the quantiles from theoretical distributions, quantiles
of 0 and 1 break things:[^embo]


```r
# 0 and 1 quantiles of a normal distribution
qnorm(c(0, 1))
#> [1] -Inf  Inf
```

Instead, we will adjust the ranks by 1/2, so that the quantiles are "centered"
in their .05 bins. That is, the first quantile of .05 will become .025.


```r
q <- (rank(x) - .5) / length(x)
q
#>  [1] 0.025 0.075 0.125 0.175 0.225 0.275 0.325 0.375 0.425 0.475 0.525 0.575
#> [13] 0.625 0.675 0.725 0.775 0.825 0.875 0.925 0.975
```

R provides a function for this purpose, [`ppoints()`][ppoints], but it includes extra
smarts for when there are 10 or fewer values. Otherwise, it does the same
adjustment by .5 that we are using.


```r
ppoints
#> function (n, a = if (n <= 10) 3/8 else 1/2) 
#> {
#>     if (length(n) > 1L) 
#>         n <- length(n)
#>     if (n > 0) 
#>         (1L:n - a)/(n + 1 - 2 * a)
#>     else numeric()
#> }
#> <bytecode: 0x00000000142fc050>
#> <environment: namespace:stats>
```

Given these quantiles, we can look up which values have these quantiles in
various distributions. For example, for a normal distribution with a mean of 100
and standard deviation of 15, the corresponding quantiles would be:


```r
round(qnorm(q, 100, 15))
#>  [1]  71  78  83  86  89  91  93  95  97  99 101 103 105 107 109 111 114 117 122
#> [20] 129
```

Or, more to the point, we can project our observed data onto a normal
distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as our data.


```r
qnorm(q, mean(x), sd(x))
#>  [1]  4.087038  5.639679  6.502415  7.146107  7.680649  8.150992  8.580590
#>  [8]  8.983711  9.370120  9.747252 10.121407 10.498539 10.884947 11.288068
#> [15] 11.717667 12.188009 12.722552 13.366243 14.228980 15.781621
```

Let's bundle things into a dataframe and start making some plots. 


```r
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)

d <- tibble(
  x_sample = x, 
  quantile = ppoints(length(x_sample)),
  x_theoretical = qnorm(q, mean(x_sample), sd(x_sample))
)

ggplot(d) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = x_theoretical, y = x_sample)) +
  labs(
    x = "theoretical quantiles", 
    y = "sample quantiles"
  )
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/qq1-1.png" title="A Q-Q plot by using `qnorm(ppoints(length(x)), mean(x), sd(x))`, more or less." alt="A Q-Q plot by using `qnorm(ppoints(length(x)), mean(x), sd(x))`, more or less." width="66%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If we project onto the *z*-score distribution---that is, a "unit normal", a
normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1---our points (black) match
the Q-Q plot provided by ggplot2 (red points):


```r
d$z_theoretical <- qnorm(d$quantile, 0, 1)

ggplot(d) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = z_theoretical, y = x_sample), size = 3) +
  geom_qq(aes(sample = x_sample), color = "red") + 
  labs(
    x = "theoretical quantiles", 
    y = "sample quantiles"
  )
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/qq2-1.png" title="A Q-Q plot by using `qnorm(ppoints(length(x)), 0, 1)`." alt="A Q-Q plot by using `qnorm(ppoints(length(x)), 0, 1)`." width="66%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### A math-less description of what we are doing

We can think of this quantile-quantile procedure in terms of database operations:

  - Start with two tables `a` and `b` with the same numbers of rows
  - For each one, create a `quantile` "index" for the value of interest.
  - Now join the datasets using the quantile index: `left_join(a, b, by =
    "quantile")`

If `a` and `b` were tables of real-life collected data, that's the procedure we
would follow. For Q-Q plots, however, the second dataset `b` almost always isn't
a table of observations. Instead, we "look up" the values using math by
computing values from a theoretical distribution. (Or in an older stats
textbook, you actually would look up these values in a table in the back of the
book.)

## The Q-Q line is trickier

Q-Q plots usually come with a reference line so that we can assess whether the
two sets of quantiles follow a linear trend. Until recently, I thought the line
was $$y = \mathrm{mean} + \mathrm{SD} * x$$, so that the line increased by one
standard deviation on the sample scale (*y*) given a one standard deviation change
in the theoretical scale (*x*). But that is not the case:



```r
p <- ggplot(d) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = z_theoretical, y = x_sample)) + 
  geom_abline(
    aes(intercept = mean, slope = sd, color = "Naive: mean + SD * x"),
    data = tibble(sd = sd(d$x_sample), mean = mean(d$x_sample))
  ) +
  geom_qq_line(
    aes(sample = x_sample, color = "R: Something else"),
    # use the abline glyph in the legend
    key_glyph = draw_key_abline
  ) +
  labs(
    color = "Q-Q line",
    x = "theoretical quantiles", 
    y = "sample quantiles"
  ) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.justification =  "left")
p
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/qq3-1.png" title="A Q-Q plot showing two disagreeing reference lines." alt="A Q-Q plot showing two disagreeing reference lines." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This recent discovery mystified me. This line from the help page for
[`qqline()`][qqnorm] offered a clue:

> `qqline` adds a line to a “theoretical”, by default normal, quantile-quantile
> plot which passes through the probs quantiles, by default the first and third
> quartiles.

Indeed, if we draw points at the .25 and .75 quantiles, we can see that the they
land on R's Q-Q line.


```r
anchors <- tibble(
  x = qnorm(c(.25, .75)),
  y = quantile(d$x_sample, c(.25, .75))
)

p + 
  geom_point(
    aes(x = x, y = y), 
    data = anchors, 
    shape = 3, 
    size = 5, 
    stroke = 1.1, 
    color = "blue"
  )
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/qq4-1.png" title="The previous plot updated with crosses marking the quartiles of each distribution. R's line passes through the lines." alt="The previous plot updated with crosses marking the quartiles of each distribution. R's line passes through the lines." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Fox explains that this is a "robust" estimate for the line: 

> We can alternatively use the median as a robust estimator of [the mean] and
> the interquartile range / 1.349 as a robust estimator of [the standard
> deviation]. (The more conventional estimates [of the sample mean and SD]
> will not work well when the data are substantially non-normal.) [p. 39].

We can confirm the previous plot by updating the previous plot. We draw a third
line for the robust estimate and it follows the line from `geom_qqline()`.


```r
p + 
  geom_abline(
    aes(
      intercept = mean, 
      slope = sd, 
      color = "Robust: median + IQR / 1.349 * x"
    ),
    data = tibble(
      sd = IQR(d$x_sample) / 1.349, 
      mean = median(d$x_sample)
    )
  ) 
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/qq5-1.png" title="The earlier plot with two lines with a third line added. But we only see two lines because the robust line matches the default reference line." alt="The earlier plot with two lines with a third line added. But we only see two lines because the robust line matches the default reference line." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## A confidence band helps

One problem with these Q-Q plots is that it is hard to tell whether the points
are straying too far away from the line. We can include a 95% confidence band to
support interpretation. Fox provides an equation for the standard error for a
quantile. 

$$
\mathrm{SE}(X_i) = \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{p(z_i)}\sqrt{\frac{P_i(1-P_i)}{n}} \\
\begin{align}
X_i &: \mathrm{the\ }{i}\mathrm{^{th}\ observation} \\
P_i &: \mathrm{probabilities\ from\ }\mathtt{ppoints()} \\
p() &: \mathrm{a\ probability\ density\ function\ like\ }\mathtt{dnorm()}  \\
z_i &: \mathrm{theoretical\ quantile\ like\ }\mathtt{qnorm(}P_i\mathtt{)}  \\
\hat{\sigma} &: \mathrm{estimated\ standard\ deviation}\\
\end{align}
$$

The equation appears to be the square root of [the variance of a
quantile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_quantiles_from_a_sample).
The right part under the square root also looks like [the standard error of
proportion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval),
so we could think of this equation as rescaling the standard error of a
proportion.

The function `se_z()` applies the equation to a *z*-score (the theoretical
values on the *x* axis).


```r
# Given z scores and n, produce a standard error
se_z <- function(z, n) {
  sqrt(pnorm(z) * (1 - pnorm(z)) / n) / dnorm(z)
}
```

In the code below, we create a grid of 300 *z* values and compute the standard
error at those values. We weight the standard errors by the standard deviation
to convert to the sample scale and multiply the standard errors by 2 and -2
to get approximate 95% intervals around the reference lines. We do this whole
procedure again but using robust estimates.


```r
band <- tibble(
  z = seq(-2.2, 2.2, length.out = 300),
  n = length(d$x_sample),
  
  sample_sd = sd(d$x_sample),
  se = sample_sd * se_z(z, n),
  line = mean(d$x_sample) + sample_sd * z,
  upper = line + 2 * se,
  lower = line - 2 * se,
  
  robust_sd = IQR(d$x_sample) / 1.349,
  robust_line = median(d$x_sample) + z * robust_sd,
  robust_se =  robust_sd * se_z(z, n),
  robust_upper = robust_line + 2 * robust_se,
  robust_lower = robust_line - 2 * robust_se,
)

ggplot(d) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = z_theoretical, y = x_sample)) + 
  geom_abline(
    aes(intercept = mean, slope = sd),
    data = tibble(sd = sd(d$x_sample), mean = mean(d$x_sample))
  ) +
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(x = z, ymax = upper, ymin = lower), 
    data = band, 
    fill = NA, 
    color = "black",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "theoretical quantiles", 
    y = "sample quantiles"
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.justification =  "left")
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/qq6-1.png" title="A Q-Q plot with a confidence band." alt="A Q-Q plot with a confidence band." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We would like to see these points track along the reference line, but the
confidence band shows that we can expect the quantiles in the tails will be a
little noisier than the ones in the middle. Fox notes that these confidence
values are *pointwise* (applying to individual points) and not *simultaneous*
(applying to the whole band), meaning there is "there is a greater probability
that *at least point* point strays outside the envelope even if the data are
sampled from the comparison distribution. [p. 39, footnote]". (I am not quite
sure what that means, honestly. I know [what the distinction means for
smooths](https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2016/12/15/simultaneous-interval-revisited/)
but not for this case.) 

Let's also check our work against the car package which provides robust
confidence bands with its Q-Q plots. We first plot the car package's Q-Q plot
and observe its confidence band in blue. Then we plot it again but draw black
lines for our hand-calculated confidence band. Because our lines overlap the car
package's lines, we essentially match its implementation. (Internally, it
uses 1.96 standard errors. We used 2 standard errors.)


```r
# Set margins on Q-Q plots
par(mar = c(4, 2, 1, 2))

# Use patchwork to capture the plots and combine them 
# into a side by side display.
library(patchwork)
p1 <- wrap_elements(~ car::qqPlot(x))

p2 <- wrap_elements(~ {
  car::qqPlot(x)
  lines(band$z, band$robust_line, col = "black", lwd = 2)
  lines(band$z, band$robust_upper, col = "black", lwd = 2)
  lines(band$z, band$robust_lower, col = "black", lwd = 2)
})

p1 + p2
```

First one shows the default from the car package. The second one is the same but draws black lines over the original blue lines to confirm that our calculations worked." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


## Worm plots 🐛

Finally, I would like to implement my preferred alternative to Q-Q plot: the
worm plot. I first encountered these in [the gamlss
package](https://rdrr.io/cran/gamlss/man/wp.html). The idea is appealing: The Q-Q
plot wastes a lot of vertical space showing a line go upwards. If we remove that
line---or rotate it to be a horizontal line---then we can devote the vertical
space in the plot for showing the deviation around the reference line. These are
sometimes called "detrended" Q-Q plots because they remove the diagonal trend of
the Q-Q comparison line.

We can use the gamlss implementation if we pretend that the data are residuals
from a model:


```r
par(mar = c(4.5, 4.5, 1, 2))

# I don't know what's up with that error message.

# use scale() to transform in to z-score
gamlss::wp(
  resid = scale(d$x_sample), 
  xlim.all = 2.5, 
  line = FALSE
)
#> Error in coef(fit): object 'fit' not found
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp1-1.png" title="A worm plot!" alt="A worm plot!" width="66%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This plot shows the basic idea: We are comparing quantiles along a line and we
have a confidence band that helps us gauge the deviation around that line.

Because the "trend" we are going to "detrend" is just a reference line, we can
detrend the data by subtracting the line. Here we use the "naive" calculation of
the line for a worm plot.


```r
d$line <- mean(d$x_sample) + d$z_theoretical * sd(d$x_sample)

ggplot(d) + 
  geom_point(
    aes(x = z_theoretical, y = x_sample - line)
  ) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_ribbon(
    # don't add the line to the SEs
    aes(x = z, ymax = 2 * se, ymin = - 2 * se), 
    data = band, 
    fill = NA, 
    color = "black"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "theoretical quantiles", 
    y = "sample deviation"
  )
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp2-1.png" title="A worm plot from scratch" alt="A worm plot from scratch" width="66%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The values on the *y* axis differ between this plot and the one from `wp()`.
That's because the data for `wp()` were fully rescaled with `scale()`: They were
mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation to become *z* scores. Here
we only subtracted the mean line.

## Q-Q Recap

That covers the main points I'd like to make about Q-Q plots:

  - We are joining two distributions together using quantiles and comparing them
    visually.
  - The default Q-Q plot uses robust estimates of the mean and standard
    deviation.
  - `car::qqPlot()` provides the best option for routine visualization.
  - Worm plots subtract the reference line from the points, so I think they are
    better option.

## Bonus: Let's create `stat_worm()`

I would like to implement a basic normal-family worm plot in ggplot2 so that I
can call `stat_worm()` and `stat_worm_band()`. I would also like to learn how to
write my own extensions to ggplot2, so this task is useful learning exercise. I
admit that I copied extensively from some sources:

  - The [source
    code](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/R/stat-qq.r) for
    `stat_qq()`
  - The [extensions
    vignette](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/extending-ggplot2.html) for
    ggplot2
  - The [extensions chapters](https://ggplot2-book.org/extensions.html) in the
    ggplot2 book

The code walkthrough below will make the work seem effortless, but I
spent a while trying to figure it out!

The apparent workflow is to write a user-facing "layer" function and
then create `ggProto()` objects that do the work behind the scenes, so
that's what we will do.

We start with `stat_worm()`. I copied the `stat_qq()` source code and
removed some options for supporting other distributions. I
code-commented above the lines that are not boilerplate. 

```r
stat_worm <- function(
  mapping = NULL, 
  data = NULL,
  geom = "point", 
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  # important part
  robust = FALSE,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
) {
  layer(
    data = data,
    mapping = mapping,
    # important part
    stat = StatWorm,
    geom = geom,
    position = position,
    show.legend = show.legend,
    inherit.aes = inherit.aes,
    # important part
    params = list(
      robust = robust,
      na.rm = na.rm,
      ...
    ),
  )
}
```

The main work will be carried out by `stat = StatWorm`, the
`ggProto` object that will do the calculations. The computed values will be
drawn, by default, with `geom = "point"`. I provide an option for `robust`
estimates in the function arguments and in the list of `params`. 


Now we create `StatWorm`. The `default_aes` and `required_aes` set up the
aesthetic mappings. The main work is in `compute_group()`. It will receive a
dataframe `data` with a column of the `sample` values, and we compute naive or
robust quantile values as above. The function returns an updated dataframe with
the columns `sample` and `theoretical` which match the `after_stat()` calls in
`default_aes`. We also bundle up some other numbers we calculated along the way,
like `quantiles` or `scaled_theoretical`, so they are available for more 
advanced plotting situations.


```r
StatWorm <- ggproto(
  "StatWorm",
  Stat,
  default_aes = aes(
    y = after_stat(sample_deviation), 
    x = after_stat(theoretical)
  ),
  required_aes = c("sample"),
  compute_group = function(data, scales, robust = FALSE) {
    sample <- sort(data$sample)
    n <- length(sample)
    quantiles <- ppoints(n)
    
    if (robust) {
      mean <- median(sample)
      sd <- IQR(sample) / 1.349
    } else {
      mean <- mean(sample)
      sd <- sd(sample)
    }
    
    scaled_theoretical <- qnorm(quantiles, mean, sd)
    theoretical <- qnorm(quantiles)
 
    data.frame(
      sample = sample,
      quantile = quantiles,
      # detrended
      sample_deviation = sample - scaled_theoretical, 
      scaled_theoretical = scaled_theoretical,
      theoretical = theoretical
    )
  }
)
```

Let's give it a try:


```r
ggplot(d) + 
  stat_worm(aes(sample = x_sample), robust = FALSE) +
  # test against above code
  geom_point(aes(x = z_theoretical, y = x_sample - line))
```

```r

d$robust_line <- 
  median(d$x_sample) + d$z_theoretical * IQR(d$x_sample) / 1.349

ggplot(d) + 
  stat_worm(aes(sample = x_sample), robust = TRUE) +
  # test against above code
  geom_point(aes(x = z_theoretical, y = x_sample - robust_line))
```

Now, we work through the same procedure with the confidence band. First, create
the user-facing layer function that we want to use.


```r
stat_worm_band <- function(
  mapping = NULL, 
  data = NULL,
  geom = GeomRibbonHollow, 
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  # important part
  robust = FALSE,
  band_width = .95,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
) {
  layer(
    data = data,
    mapping = mapping,
    # important part
    stat = StatWormBand,
    geom = geom,
    position = position,
    show.legend = show.legend,
    inherit.aes = inherit.aes,
    # important part
    params = list(
      robust = robust,
      band_width = band_width,
      na.rm = na.rm,
      ...
    ),
  )
}
```

The easiest way to draw two lines in a confidence band is with `geom_ribbon()`,
but `geom_ribbon()` by default draws a filled shape. It would fill the space
between the lines with solid black. (It was a pain while developing this code!)
Fortunately, the vignette gives an example of modifying an existing geom to take
new defaults. We follow that example and create a new `GeomRibbonHollow`:


```r
GeomRibbonHollow <- ggproto(
  # Make this geom
  "GeomRibbonHollow", 
  # inheriting from:
  GeomRibbon,
  # but changing this:
  default_aes = aes(
    colour = "black", 
    fill = NA, 
    size = 0.5, 
    linetype = 1,
    alpha = NA)
  )
```

Next, we create `StatWormBand`. It's the same kind of code as above in the post,
in this case written generically for a dataframe called `data` with a column
called `sample`.


```r
StatWormBand <- ggproto(
  "StatWormBand", 
  Stat,
  default_aes = aes(
    x = after_stat(theoretical),
  ),
  required_aes = c("sample"),
  compute_group = function(data, scales, robust = FALSE, band_width = .95) {
    sample <- sort(data$sample)
    n <- length(sample)
    quantiles <- ppoints(n)
    
    if (robust) {
      mean <- median(sample)
      sd <- IQR(sample) / 1.349
    } else {
      mean <- mean(sample)
      sd <- sd(sample)
    }

    theoretical <- qnorm(quantiles)
    # at least 80 points for the curves
    steps <- if (n < 80) 80 else n
    z_range <- seq(min(theoretical), max(theoretical), length.out = steps)
    scaled_theoretical <- z_range * sd + mean

    # i.e., convert .95 to .025 and .975 and convert those to z scores
    band_z <- qnorm((1 + c(-band_width, band_width)) / 2)
    
    se_z <- function(z, n) {
      sqrt(pnorm(z) * (1 - pnorm(z)) / n) / dnorm(z)
    }
    
    ymin <- band_z[1] * se_z(z_range, n) * sd
    ymax <- band_z[2] * se_z(z_range, n) * sd
    
    data.frame(
      quantile = quantiles,
      theoretical = z_range,
      scaled_theoretical = scaled_theoretical,
      ymin = ymin,
      ymax = ymax
    )
  }
)
```


Okay, moment of truth:


```r
ggplot(d) + 
  stat_worm(aes(sample = x_sample)) +
  # original version from above
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(x = z, ymax = upper - line, ymin = lower - line), 
    data = band, 
    fill = NA,
    color = "blue"
  ) +
  stat_worm_band(aes(sample = x_sample)) 
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp5-1.png" title="A worm plot of Q-Q points with a confidence band." alt="A worm plot of Q-Q points with a confidence band." width="66%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The bands differ slightly because `stat_worm_band()` uses 1.96 standard errors
for its confidence band (instead of 2) and because `stat_worm_band()` matches
the range of the data (our earlier example manually set the range).

Finally, let's look at the robust version:


```r
ggplot(d) + 
  stat_worm(aes(sample = x_sample), robust = TRUE) +
  # for comparison
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(
      x = z, 
      ymax = robust_upper - robust_line, 
      ymin = robust_lower - robust_line
    ), 
    data = band, 
    fill = NA,
    color = "blue"
  ) +
  stat_worm_band(aes(sample = x_sample), robust = TRUE) 
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp6-1.png" title="A worm plot of Q-Q points with a confidence band using robust estimates." alt="A worm plot of Q-Q points with a confidence band using robust estimates." width="66%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This implementation is a decent start. A more complete version would support
other reference distributions besides the normal distribution and allow some
calculations to be fixed. That is, with this version, if we facet the data or
color the lines, the statistics are calculated separately for each facet, color,
etc. (We compute the statistics with the `compute_group()` function, separately
for each aesthetic group.) Each group of data is a new dataset, not a
highlighted part of the original distribution. Plotting different subsets of
data in different colors but keeping them part of the same quantile
calculation would be useful for exploring which subsets of data are deviating
away from 0.


## Bonus 2: A test run on some distributions

[*Section added on 2020-08-27*.] It's time for the worm crawl through some dirt.
We'll use the simulated datasets from [Sean Kross's tutorial][skqq] and look at
how badly behaved distributions look for normal-distribution worm plots. First,
let's create the diagnostic examples.


```r
set.seed(2-25-16)
n <- 1000
normal <- rnorm(n)

draws <- list(
  normal = normal,
  `skew left`  = c(normal[normal < 0] * 2.5, normal),
  `skew right` = c(normal[normal > 0] * 2.5, normal),
  `fat tails` = c(normal * 2.5, normal),
  # This will be different from the original post.
  # Wikipedia says the uniform () is ~*platykurtotic*~ 
  `thin tails` = c(rnorm(200), runif(800, -1.5, 1.5))
)

# create a list column then unnest() to get a tidy dataframe
df <- tibble::tibble(
  example = factor(names(draws), names(draws)), 
  values = draws
) 
df <- tidyr::unnest(df, values)

ggplot(df, aes(x = values)) + 
  geom_histogram(
    aes(y = after_stat(density)), 
    bins = 30, 
    color = "white"
  ) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, color = "blue", size = 1, n = 200) +
  facet_wrap("example", scales = "free_x")
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/dx-1.png" title="Five histograms with density curves showing different data shapes." alt="Five histograms with density curves showing different data shapes." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

First, let's start with a good worm plot. The points from a normal distribution
almost all fall within the confidence band.


```r
p <- ggplot(subset(df, example == "normal")) + 
  aes(sample = values) + 
  stat_worm(shape = 1, alpha = .3) + 
  stat_worm_band() + 
  facet_wrap("example", scales = "free")
p
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp7-1.png" title="A worm plot for normally distributed data." alt="A worm plot for normally distributed data." width="66%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For skewed data, the worm takes on a *U* shape.


```r
# Use the `plot + list(data)` to replace the data in the plot
p + 
  list(
    subset(df, example %in% c("skew left", "skew right"))
  )
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp8-1.png" title="Worm plots for skewed distributed data." alt="Worm plots for skewed distributed data." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can think through why we are seeing what we are seeing here. It's not easy or
obvious, but let's go for it: Sample quantiles that are larger than expected
(based on the theoretical distribution) will break through the ceiling (upper
confidence line), and sample quantiles that are smaller than expected will break
through the floor (lower confidence line). In the left skewed data, there is a
long tail to the left, so the left values fall through the floor: The
empirical 5th percentile is smaller than the 5th percentile from the theoretical
distribution. The peak of the skewed data---see the histogram above---occurs to
the left of the theoretical peak. That earlier peak means those values are
larger than expected, so the worm breaks through the ceiling. Finally, the right
tail is thinner for the left skewed data compared to the normal distribution, so
again the empirical values fall through the floor. 

The code below compares quantiles from the *z*-scores for the observed data and
*z*-scores from the theoretical distribution, showing that the signs change as I
just described.


```r
# smaller than theoretical
quantile(scale(draws$`skew left`), .05, names = FALSE)
#> [1] -1.916239
qnorm(.05)
#> [1] -1.644854

# bigger than theoretical
quantile(scale(draws$`skew left`), .5, names = FALSE)
#> [1] 0.1376894
qnorm(.5)
#> [1] 0

# smaller than theoretical
quantile(scale(draws$`skew left`), .95, names = FALSE)
#> [1] 1.387601
qnorm(.95)
#> [1] 1.644854
```

The right skewed data would follow the same idea, but *flipped*. 


The fat and thin tailed data show *S* shapes.


```r
p + 
  list(
    subset(df, example %in% c("fat tails", "thin tails"))
  )
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp9-1.png" title="A worm plot for fail tailed and thin tailed data." alt="A worm plot for fail tailed and thin tailed data." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The fat-tailed data has values that are smaller than expected on the left tail
(falling through the floor) and larger than expected on the right tail (breaking
through the ceiling), so that explains tails of that worm plot. The middle bumps
are harder to figure out, but I think looking at the quantiles helps. (Note that
this plot shows that including those extra columns in `StatWorm$compute_group()`
has paid off because we can now access them with `after_stat()`.)


```r
ggplot(subset(df, example == "fat tails")) + 
  aes(sample = values) +
  geom_line(
    aes(
      x = after_stat(sample), 
      y = after_stat(quantile), 
      color = "empirical"
    ), 
    stat = StatWorm
  ) +
  geom_line(
    aes(
      x = after_stat(scaled_theoretical), 
      y = after_stat(quantile), 
      color = "normal"
    ), 
    stat = StatWorm
  ) +
  labs(color = "Quantile source") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.justification =  "left")
```

<img src="/figs/2020-08-26-quantile-quantile-plots-from-scratch/wp10-1.png" title="Two cumulative plots showing them trading places." alt="Two cumulative plots showing them trading places." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can see how the lines switch places a few times. That the normal line
is to right of the empirical line at *y* = .75 means that at that
quantile, the normal distribution has larger values than the scaled
empirical distribution. For the thin tailed data, the same reasoning
applies but once again, it's *flipped*.

Finally, I want to advertise that Table 2 in the [worm plot
paper][wp] summarizes these heuristics (like *U*-shaped and
*S*-shaped worms) and includes other heuristics about the slope and
intercept of the worm.
