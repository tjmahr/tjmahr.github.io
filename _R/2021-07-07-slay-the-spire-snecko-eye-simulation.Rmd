In [a previous post](/pokemon-go-unown-simulation), I used simulations
to estimate how long it would take to collect the unique Unowns in
*Pokemon Go!* The message of the post was that we can use simulations
to solve problems when the analytic solution is not clear or obvious.
The current post is an another example of using simulations to
understand a weird counting/probability problem.

***

Over the past strange year, I sunk a lot of time into [*Slay the
Spire*][mega-crit], a [rogue-like] deck-building game. You have to
escape from a 50-floor spire, fighting monsters by playing cards. The
cards let you attack, defend, apply buffs and debuffs, draw cards, etc.
You start each turn with a given amount of energy, the cards cost energy
(with the more impactful effects costing more energy), so you need to
plan out how to play your turns in order to defeat the monsters. You
receive more cards from winning battles and can receive special relics
that will make you stronger or change how your deck plays.

That's the basic gist of the game. The sublime part comes when the
cards and relics start synergistically empowering each other and
comboing off each other. You might get the curse [Pain] which drains you of 1
health every time you play a card. (This is bad.) But
then you find a [Rupture] which increases your strength every time you
take damage from a card. Then you get [Runic Cube] which draws you a
card every time you take damage. Finally, you find [Reaper] which
converts damage into health. So you now have this card-drawing,
strength-building, self-sustaining engine that makes you unstoppable.
(This [particular scenario](https://youtu.be/OySMKDSWsTE) unfolded in a
recent game by the streamer Jorbs.)

We see a hand of 5 cards at the bottom with 1/3 energy available on the left." %}{: style="max-width: 80%; display: block; margin: 2em auto;"}

The exercise today: **simulate the maximum number of cards we can
play per turn** under normal circumstances and when a game-warping relic
(Snecko Eye) is active.

## A baseline deck

Let's consider a baseline setup for comparison. 

  - We have 3 energy to play cards per turn.
  - We draw 5 cards per turn.
  - Our deck has 16 cards: 1 card costs 0 energy, 12 cost 1 energy, 3
    cost 2 energy, and 1 costs 3 energy.

(I made up this deck for this example.) 

If we build our deck, we can find the average cost of our cards and
simulate some draws by sampling without replacement.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
set.seed(20210707)

costs <- c(0, rep(1, 12), rep(2, 3), 3)
costs

mean(costs)

# Simulate 3 hands
sample(costs, size = 5)
sample(costs, size = 5)
sample(costs, size = 5)
```

Suppose that we don't really care about what the cards do. We want to
maximize the number of cards that we can play per turn. We just want to
know: **How many cards per turn can I expect to play on average?** 

Let's write a function that counts the number of playable cards in a
hand given a certain energy cost. The basic logic is that we sort the
costs, compute the cumulative sum (cumulative energy spent on each card),
and count how many sums are less than or equal to the energy limit. 

```{r}
# A worked example
energy <- 3
hand <- sample(costs, size = 5)
hand
sort(hand)
cumsum(sort(hand))
cumsum(sort(hand)) <= energy 
sum(cumsum(sort(hand)) <= energy)

count_max_playable <- function(hand, energy) {
  sum(cumsum(sort(hand)) <= energy)
}

count_max_playable(hand, energy)
```

Now, we can do this procedure on several thousand hands and run summary
statistics on those hands. 

```{r}
simulated_cards_played <- replicate(
  10000,
  sample(costs, size = 5) %>% 
    count_max_playable(energy = 3)
)

summary(simulated_cards_played)

table(simulated_cards_played)

proportions(table(simulated_cards_played))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
f_mean <- scales::label_number(0.1)
f_prop <- scales::label_percent(0.1)
m <- mean(simulated_cards_played) %>% f_mean()

p2 <- mean(simulated_cards_played == 2) %>% f_prop()
p4 <- mean(simulated_cards_played == 4) %>% f_prop()
```

The expected number of playable cards per hand is `r m`. The dreaded
(1, 2, 2, 2, 3) hand appears about `r p2` of the time, but the 0 card
lets us play a fourth card about `r p4` of the time. 


## Enter the Snecko

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2021-07-snecko.png" alt="A screenshot of Snecko Eye" caption="Snecko Eye is probably the best relic in the game." %}{: style="max-width: 80%; display: block; margin: 2em auto;"}


Now, let's suppose we obtain the mighty [Snecko Eye] relic. It says
"Draw 2 additional cards each turn. Start each combat Confused."
Confused is a debuff that randomizes the costs of cards when we draw
them. So now our setup is the following:

  - We have 3 energy to play cards per turn.
  - We draw 7 cards per turn.
  - Our deck has 16 cards: the costs are random integers between 0 and 3
    energy.

The average energy cost of any given card in our deck is now
`mean(0:3)`Â = 1.5. In the baseline example, the average energy cost
was 1.24. (One obvious strategy with Snecko Eye is to maximize the costs of
new cards---that is, try to get as many as 2s and 3s as possible because
the new expected cost is less than the original cost. But let's ignore that 
dimension of gameplay for now.)

So here's the puzzle, **how many cards per turn can I play with Snecko
Eye?** We can run the same simulations as above.


```{r}
snecko_costs <- 0:3 
simulated_snecko_cards_played <- replicate(
  10000,
  sample(snecko_costs, size = 7, replace = TRUE) %>% 
    count_max_playable(energy = 3)
)

summary(simulated_snecko_cards_played)

table(simulated_snecko_cards_played)

proportions(table(simulated_snecko_cards_played))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
f_mean <- scales::label_number(0.1)
f_prop <- scales::label_percent(0.1)
ms <- mean(simulated_snecko_cards_played) %>% f_mean()

ps1 <- mean(simulated_snecko_cards_played == 1) %>% f_prop()
ps7 <- mean(simulated_snecko_cards_played == 7) %>% f_prop()
ps4plus <- mean(simulated_snecko_cards_played >= 4) %>% f_prop()
```

Let us note that the dream---playing 7 cards in one turn---happened
about `r ps7` of the time and the nightmare---drawing only 2-cost
and 3-cost cards---happened `r ps1` of the time. Recall that in the
baseline setup, we got to play 4 cards `r p4` of the time. With Snecko
Eye, we can play 4 or more cards per turn `r ps4plus` of the time.
Snecko Eye simply lets us play more cards on average.


### Where does this power come from?

Is the magic of Snecko Eye the card draw or the cost randomization?
Well, let's suppose that we are just confused and we draw only 5 cards
(as in the baseline example.)

```{r}
simulated_confused_cards_played <- replicate(
  10000,
  sample(snecko_costs, size = 5, replace = TRUE) %>% 
    count_max_playable(energy = 3)
)

summary(simulated_confused_cards_played)

table(simulated_confused_cards_played)

proportions(table(simulated_confused_cards_played))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mc <- mean(simulated_confused_cards_played) %>% f_mean()

pc1 <- mean(simulated_confused_cards_played == 1) %>% f_prop()
pc4plus <- mean(simulated_confused_cards_played >= 4) %>% f_prop()
```

Here the average number of cards played is `r mc` and we play 4--5 cards
per turn `r pc4plus` of the time. This percentage is greater than the
baseline case (`r p4`), but the nightmare case is worse (1 card),
occuring `r pc1` of the time.


We can plot the three simulations side by side and observe the
distributions. First, we package them together into a single dataframe
suitable for plotting and plot a bar chart.

```{r bar-by-three, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3, dpi = 300, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "A one by three plot showing a histogram of playable cards for each simulation set. It's title says 'Confusion increases variance. Card draw increases mean.'"}
library(ggplot2)

sim1 <- data.frame(
  set = "Baseline",
  energy = 3,
  cards = simulated_cards_played
)

sim2 <- data.frame(
  set = "Snecko Eye",
  energy = 3,
  cards = simulated_snecko_cards_played
)

sim3 <- data.frame(
  set = "Confused",
  energy = 3,
  cards = simulated_confused_cards_played
)

sims <- rbind(sim1, sim2, sim3)

ggplot(sims) + 
  aes(x = cards) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = stat(prop))) + 
  facet_wrap("set") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7, minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  labs(
    title = "Confusion increases variance. Card draw increases mean.",
    x = "Number of playable of cards in hand", 
    y = "Percentage of hands",
    caption = "N = 10,000 simulations per panel"
  ) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 12)
```

Both the confused and the Snecko Eye panels have increased variance. The
bars are shorter and more spread out, compared to the Baseline panel.
The peak (the mode) shifts from 3 to 4 cards from the Confused and Snecko
Eye panels.

A more statistically niche technique would be plotting the [empirical
cumulative distribution function][ecdf]. Imagine taking the bars from
the previous plot and summing them along the *x* axis so that they are
cumulative percentages. These percentages would tell you about the
percentage of cases less than or equal to that given value. In the plot
below, I do that procedure on reversed *x* axis, so we can look at what
proportion of simulations had at least 4 cards played. (I chose the
reversed *x* axis to visually convey the advantage of Snecko Eye.)

```{r ecdf, dpi = 300, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4.5, fig.asp = NA, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "A plot of the ECDF for the proportion of hands with at least x playable cards. Snecko dominates the other lines in the plot because we can play more cards per turn with it. There is a caption at the center of the plot that says 'Snecko can play 4 or more\ncards in 60% of hands'."}
library(dplyr)

props <- sims %>% 
  count(set, cards) %>% 
  # Fill in rows that would be n = 0
  tidyr::complete(set, cards = 1:7, fill = list(n = 0)) %>% 
  # Compute ECDF in reverse order (dtarting at 7 cards)
  arrange(set, desc(cards)) %>% 
  group_by(set) %>% 
  mutate(
    proportion = n / sum(n),
    ecdf = cumsum(proportion)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() 

ggplot(props) + 
  aes(x = cards) +
  geom_step(
    aes(y = ecdf , color = set, linetype = set), 
    direction = "mid"
  ) +
  geom_label(
    aes(color = set, y = ecdf),
    label = "Snecko can play 4 or more\ncards in 60% of hands",
    data = . %>% filter(set == "Snecko Eye", cards == 4), 
    y = .65,
    nudge_x = -.25,
    hjust = 1.0,
    vjust = 0, 
    fill = scales::alpha("grey93", .6),
    label.size = 0, 
    show.legend = FALSE,
    size = 4.5,
  ) +
  scale_x_reverse(breaks = 7:0, minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  labs(
    x = "At least X playable cards in hand",
    y = "Percentage of hands",
    caption = "N = 10,000 simulations per line",
    color = NULL,
    linetype = NULL
  ) + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "top", 
    legend.justification = "left"
  )

```



### The advantage at higher energy

During a run through the game, we can obtain up to two relics (along
with Snecko Eye) that increase our energy per turn by 1 unit. Let's see
how these new energy budgets affect the simulations.

First, we run the simulations. We put the main code into functions so that 
we can build the dataframes more easily.

```{r}
simulate_decko <- function(n, energy, costs, size = 5) {
  replicate(
    n,
    sample(costs, size = size) %>% 
      count_max_playable(energy = energy)
  )
}

simulate_snecko <- function(n, energy, size = 7) {
  snecko_costs <- 0:3
  replicate(
    n,
    sample(snecko_costs, size = size, replace = TRUE) %>% 
      count_max_playable(energy = energy)
  )
}

additional_sims <- rbind(
  # include old results
  sims,
  data.frame(
    set = "Baseline",
    energy = 4,
    cards = simulate_decko(10000, 4, costs)
  ),
  data.frame(
    set = "Baseline",
    energy = 5,
    cards = simulate_decko(10000, 5, costs)
  ),
  data.frame(
    set = "Snecko Eye",
    energy = 4,
    cards = simulate_snecko(10000, 4)
  ),
  data.frame(
    set = "Snecko Eye",
    energy = 5,
    cards = simulate_snecko(10000, 5)
  ),
  data.frame(
    set = "Confused",
    energy = 4,
    cards = simulate_snecko(10000, 4, size = 5)
  ),
  data.frame(
    set = "Confused",
    energy = 5,
    cards = simulate_snecko(10000, 5, size = 5)
  )
)
```

We can make the same kind of plot as before. We see that the
distribution with the highest mode (the peak that lands on the highest
number of cards) in each row is Snecko Eye.

```{r 3-by-3, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, out.width = "100%", fig.caption = "A three by three plot of simulation set by energy cost."}
ggplot(additional_sims %>% mutate(energy = paste0(energy, " energy"))) + 
  aes(x = cards) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = stat(prop))) + 
  facet_grid(energy ~ set) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7, minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  labs(
    x = "Number of playable of cards in hand", 
    y = "Percentage of hands",
    caption = "N = 10,000 simulations per panel"
  ) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 12)
```

One limitation of the other two non-Snecko sets becomes more obvious in
the 5-energy row: They can never play 6 or 7 cards in a turn. They don't
draw that many cards. Their distributions are cut off at 5 cards.

If we look at numerical summaries, we get some sense that the benefit of
Snecko diminishes as energy increases but we won't explore this trend in
any detail.

```{r}
additional_sims %>% 
  group_by(set, energy) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(cards),
    sd = sd(cards),
    median = median(cards),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c(mean, sd, median)) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = energy, 
    values_from = value, 
    names_prefix = "Energy "
  ) %>% 
  rename(Set = set, Statistic = name) %>% 
  arrange(Statistic, Set) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```



### You should probably play Snecko

We could go on and on with the simulations. Suppose you are dying and
you are desperate need of the [Apparition] on the top of your deck.
How many cards can you play after you are forced to play that card? Or
suppose that you are, rightly, playing on Ascension 20 and one of the
cards is an unplayable curse. Does that change anything? 

The point here is that we used simulations to visualize how
randomization increased the variance of playable cards but the extra
cards shifted the mode of the distribution upwards. You can play more
cards with Snecko Eye because you simply have more cards you can play
per turn.
