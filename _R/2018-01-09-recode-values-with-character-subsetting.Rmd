Do you ever have to recode many values at once? It's a frequent chore when 
preparing data. For example, suppose we had to replace state abbreviations 
with the full names:

```{r}
abbs <- c("AL", "AK", "AZ", "AZ", "WI", "WS")
```

You could write several `ifelse()` statements.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ifelse(abbs == "AL", "Alabama", 
       ifelse(abbs == "AK", "Alaska", 
              ifelse(abbs == "AZ", "Arizona", 
```

Actually, never mind! That gets out of hand very quickly.

`case_when()` is nice, especially when the replacement rules are more complex
than 1-to-1 matching.

```{r}
dplyr::case_when(
  # Syntax: logical test ~ value to use when test is TRUE
  abbs == "AL" ~ "Alabama",
  abbs == "AK" ~ "Alaska",
  abbs == "AZ" ~ "Arizona",
  abbs == "WI" ~ "Wisconsin",
  # a fallback/default value
  TRUE ~ "No match"
)
```

We could also use one of my very favorite R tricks: 
[**Character subsetting**](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html#applications). 
We create a named vector where the names are the data we have and the values are
the data we want. I use the mnemonic `old_value = new_value`. In this case, we
make a lookup table like so:

```{r}
lookup <- c(
  # Syntax: name = value
  "AL" = "Alabama",
  "AK" = "Alaska",
  "AZ" = "Arizona",
  "WI" = "Wisconsin"
)
```

For example, subsetting with the string `"AL"` will retrieve the value with the
name `"AL"`.

```{r}
lookup["AL"]
```

With a vector of names, we can look up the values all at once.

```{r}
lookup[abbs]
```

If the names and the replacement values are stored in vectors, we can construct 
the lookup table programmatically using `setNames()`. In our case, the `datasets` 
package provides vectors with state names and state abbreviations.

```{r}
full_lookup <- setNames(datasets::state.name, datasets::state.abb)
head(full_lookup)

full_lookup[abbs]
```

One complication is that the character subsetting yields `NA` when the 
lookup table doesn't have a matching name. That's what's happening above with 
the illegal abbreviation `"WS"`. We can fix this by replacing the `NA` 
values with some default value.

```{r}
matches <- full_lookup[abbs]
matches[is.na(matches)] <- "No match"
matches
```

Finally, to clean away any traces of the matching process, we can `unname()` the
results.

```{r}
unname(matches)
```

### Many-to-one lookup tables

By the way, the lookup tables can be many-to-one. That is, different names can
retrieve the same value. For example, we can handle this example that has
synonymous names and differences in capitalization with many-to-one matching.

```{r}
lookup <- c(
  "python" = "Python", 
  "r" = "R", 
  "node" = "Javascript", 
  "js" = "Javascript", 
  "javascript" = "Javascript"
)

languages <- c("JS", "js", "Node", "R", "Python", "r", "JAvascript")

# Use tolower() to normalize the language names so 
# e.g., "R" and "r" can both match R
lookup[tolower(languages)]
```


## Character by character string replacement

I'm motivated to write about character subsetting today because I used it in a
[Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48170630/1084259). 
Here is my paraphrasing of the problem.

>       str_replace_all(c(e ="X")) 
>     #> [1] "dXvXlopXr"

>     # But this is not what I want
>     text_string %>% 
>       str_replace_all(c(e ="p", p = "e"))
>     #> [1] "develoeer"
>     
>     # Desired result would be "dpvploepr"

The iterative behavior here is that 
`str_replace_all("developer", c(e ="p", p = "e"))` first replaces `e` with `p` 
(yielding `"dpvploppr"`) and then it applies the second rule on the output of 
the first rule, replacing `p` with `e` (yielding `"develoeer"`). 

When I read this question, the replacement rules looked a lot like the lookup 
tables that I use in character subsetting so I presented a function that 
handles this problem by using character subsetting. 

Let's work through the question's example. First, let's break the string into
characters.

```{r}
input <- "developer"
rules <- c(e = "p", p = "e")

chars <- unlist(strsplit(input, ""))
chars
```

To avoid the issue of `NAs`, we create default rules so that every character in
the input is replaced by itself.

```{r}
unique_chars <- unique(chars)
complete_rules <- setNames(unique_chars, unique_chars)
complete_rules
```

Now, we overwrite the default rules with the specific ones we are interested in.

```{r}
# Find rules with the names as the real rules. 
# Replace them with the real rules.
complete_rules[names(rules)] <- rules
complete_rules
```

Then lookup with character subsetting will effectively apply all the replacement
rules. We glue the characters back together again to finish the transformation

```{r}
replaced <- unname(complete_rules[chars])
paste0(replaced, collapse = "")
```

Here is everything combined into a single function, with some additional steps
needed to handle multiple strings at once.

```{r}
str_replace_chars <- function(string, rules) {
  # Expand rules to replace characters with themselves 
  # if those characters do not have a replacement rule
  chars <- unique(unlist(strsplit(string, "")))
  complete_rules <- setNames(chars, chars)
  complete_rules[names(rules)] <- rules

  # Split each string into characters, replace and unsplit
  for (string_i in seq_along(string)) {
    chars_i <- unlist(strsplit(string[string_i], ""))
    string[string_i] <- paste0(complete_rules[chars_i], collapse = "")
  }
  string
}

rules <- c(a = "X", p = "e", e = "p")
strings <- c("application", "developer")

str_replace_chars(strings, rules)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.parent_doc <- knitr::current_input()
```
```{r, child = "_R/_footer.Rmd"}
```
