```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE
)
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(20211012)
```

On one of the Slacks I browse, someone asked how to de-identify a
column of participant IDs. The original dataset was a wait list, so
the ordering of IDs itself was a sensitive feature of the data and we
need to scramble the order of IDs produced.

For example, suppose we have the following *repeated measures* dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ participant, ~ timepoint, ~ score,
           "DB",           1,       7,
           "DB",           2,       8,
           "DB",           3,       8,
           "TW",           1,      NA,
           "TW",           2,       9,
           "CF",           1,       9,
           "CF",           2,       8,
           "JH",           1,      10,
           "JH",           2,      10,
           "JH",           3,      10
)
```

We want to map the `participant` identifiers onto some sort of
shuffled-up random IDs. Suggestions included hashing the IDs with
[digest](https://rdrr.io/pkg/digest/man/sha1.html):

```{r}
# This approach cryptographically compresses the input into a short
# "digest". (It is not a random ID.)
data %>% 
  mutate(
    participant = Vectorize(digest::sha1)(participant)
  )
```

But this approach seems like overkill, and hashing just transforms these
IDs. We want to be rid of them completely.

The [uuid](https://rdrr.io/pkg/uuid/man/UUIDgenerate.html) package provides [another approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)):

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(participant) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = uuid::UUIDgenerate(use.time = FALSE)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-participant, participant = id) %>% 
  relocate(participant)
```

Again, these IDs seem excessive: Imagine plotting data with one participant 
per facet.

When I create blogposts for this site, I use a function to create a new
.Rmd file with the date and a [random adjective-animal
phrase](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ids/man/adjective_animal.html) for a
placeholder (e.g.,Â `2021-06-28-mild-capybara.md`). We could try that for
fun:

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(participant) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = ids::adjective_animal()
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-participant, participant = id) %>% 
  relocate(participant)
```

But that's too whimsical (and something like `hideous-cheetah` seems
disrespectful for human subjects).

One user suggested [`forcats::fct_anon()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_anon.html):

```{r}
data %>% 
  mutate(
    participant = participant %>% 
      as.factor() %>% 
      forcats::fct_anon(prefix = "p0")
    )
```

This approach works wonderfully. The only wrinkle is that it requires
converting our IDs to a factor in order to work.

## Call me the `match()`-maker

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# burn up a bad random shuffle
shuffle <- sample(data$participant)
```

My approach is a nice combination of base R functions:

```{r}
data %>% 
  mutate(
    participant = match(participant, sample(unique(participant)))
  )
```

[`match(x, table)`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html) returns the first
positions of the `x` elements in some vector `table`. What is the
position in the alphabet of the letters L and Q and L again?

```{r}
match(c("L", "Q", "L"), LETTERS)
```

[`sample()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html) shuffles the values in
the `table` so the order of elements is lost. The `unique()` is
optional. We could just `sample(data$participant)`. Then the first
position of one of the IDs might be a number larger than 4:

```{r}
shuffle <- sample(data$participant)
shuffle

match(data$participant, shuffle)
```

For more aesthetically pleasing names, and for names that will sort
correctly, we can zero-pad the results with
[`sprintf()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sprintf.html). I am mostly
including this step so that I have it written down somewhere for my own
reference.

```{r}
zero_pad <- function(xs, prefix = "", width = 0) {
  # use widest element if bigger than `width`
  width <- max(c(nchar(xs), width))
  sprintf(paste0(prefix, "%0", width, "d"), xs)    
}

data %>% 
  mutate(
    participant = match(participant, sample(unique(participant))),
    participant = zero_pad(participant, "p", 3)
  )
```


### Bonus: `match()` `%in%` disguise 

What happens when `match()` fails to find an `x` in the table? By
default, we get `NA`. But we can customize the results with the
`nomatch` argument.

```{r}
match(c("7", "A", "L"), LETTERS)
match(c("7", "A", "L"), LETTERS, nomatch = -99)
match(c("7", "A", "L"), LETTERS, nomatch = 0)
```

If we do something like this last example, then we can check whether an
element in `x` has a match by checking for numbers greater than 0.

```{r}
match(c("7", "A", "L"), LETTERS, nomatch = 0) > 0
```

And that is how the functions [`%in%`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html) and [`is.element()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sets.html) are implemented
behind the scenes:

```{r}
c("7", "A", "L") %in% LETTERS

# The 0L means it's an integer number instead of floating point number
`%in%`

is.element(c("7", "A", "L"), LETTERS)

is.element
```




```{r, include = FALSE}
.parent_doc <- knitr::current_input()
```
```{r, child = "_footer.Rmd"}
```
