I recently developed and released an R package called
[solarizeddocx][sd]. It provides `solarizeddocx::document()`, an
[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) output format for
[solarized]-highlighted Microsoft Word documents . The image below
shows a comparison of the solarizeddocx and the default docx format:


{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2021-11-solarized.png" alt="Side-by-side comparison of solarizeddocx::document() and rmarkdown::word_document()" caption = "Side-by-side comparison of `solarizeddocx::document()` and [`rmarkdown::word_document()`](`r a_word_document`)." %}{: style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 2em auto;"}

The package provides a demo document which is essentially a vignette
where I describe all the customizations used by the package and put the
syntax highlighting to the test. The demo can be rendered and viewed
with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjmahr/solarizeddocx")
solarizeddocx::demo_document()
```

The format can used in RMarkdown document via YAML metadata.

```
output: 
  solarizeddocx::document: default
```

Or explicitly with rmarkdown:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render(
  "README.Rmd", 
  output_format = solarizeddocx::document()
)
```

solarizeddocx also exports its document assets so that they can be used
in other output formats, and it exports theme-building tools to create new
[pandoc] syntax highlighting themes. I am most proud of these
features, so I will demonstrate each of these in turn and create a brand
new syntax highlighting theme in this post.

## knitr: .Rmd to .md conversion

To give a simplified description, RMarkdown works by knitting the code
in an RMarkdown (.Rmd) file with [knitr] to obtain a markdown (.md) file and then post-processing
this knitr output with other tools. In particular, it uses pandoc which
converts between all kinds of document formats. For this demonstration,
we will do the knitting and pandoc steps separately without relying on
RMarkdown. That said, the options we pass to pandoc can usually be
used in RMarkdown (as we demonstrate at the very end of this post).

Our input file is a small .Rmd file. It's very basic, meant to
illustrate some function calls, strings, numbers, code comments and
output.

[knitr]: https://yihui.org/knitr/ "knitr homepage"

```{r, comment = "", echo = FALSE}
writeLines(readLines(solarizeddocx::file_code_block()))
```

We [`knit()`](`r a_knit`) the document to run the code and store results
in a markdown file. (Actually, we use [`knit_child()`](`r a_knit_child`)
because I was getting some weird using-`knit()`-inside-of-`knit()`
issues when rendering this post. But in general, we would `knit()`.)

```{r, results = 'hide'}
md_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".md")
knit_func <- if(interactive()) knitr::knit else knitr::knit_child
knit_func(
  solarizeddocx::file_code_block(), 
  output = md_file,
  quiet = TRUE
)
```

This is the content of the file.

```{r, comment = "", echo = FALSE}
writeLines(readLines(md_file))
```

## pandoc: .md to *everything* conversion

Everything we do with syntax highlighting occurs at this point when we have an .md file. For this demo, we will use
pandoc to convert this .md file to an HTML document.

To make life easier, let's set up a workflow for quickly converting a
.md file to an HTML document and taking a screenshot of the document.
`run_pandoc()` is a wrapper over
[`rmarkdown::pandoc_convert()`](`r a_pandoc_convert`) but hard-codes
some output options and lets us more easily forward `options` to pandoc
using `...`.s `page_thumbnail()` is a wrapper over
[`webshot::webshot()`](`r a_webshot`) with some predefined output
options. `pd_style()` and `pd_syntax()` are helpers we will use later
for setting pandoc options.

```{r}
run_pandoc <- function(input, ...) {
  output <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")
  rmarkdown::pandoc_convert(
    input, 
    to = "html5", 
    output = output,
    options = c(
      "--standalone", 
      ...
    )
  )
  output
}

page_thumbnail <- function(url, file, ...) {
  webshot::webshot(
    url = url,  
    file = file,
    vwidth = 500, 
    vheight = 350,
    zoom = 2
  )
}

pd_style <- function(x) c("--highlight-style", x)
pd_syntax <- function(x) c("--syntax-definition", x)
```

These tools let us preview the default syntax highlighting in pandoc:

```{r shot1, fig.cap = "Screenshot of html file created by pandoc"}
results <- run_pandoc(md_file, pd_style("tango"))
page_thumbnail(results, "shot1.png")
```

## Setting pandoc options

Here is the pandoc HTML output but this time using my solarized (light)
highlighting style:

```{r shot2, fig.cap = "Screenshot of html file created by pandoc. It now has solarized colors."}
theme_sl <- solarizeddocx::file_solarized_light_theme()
results <- run_pandoc(md_file, pd_style(theme_sl))
page_thumbnail(results, "shot2.png")
```

By convention, we see two kinds of comment lines: actual code comments
(`#`) and R output (`#>`). The `#>` comments helpful because I can copy
a whole code block (output included) and run it in R without that output
being interpreted as code. But **these comments represent two different
kinds of information**, and I'd like them to be styled differently. The
`#` code comments can stay unintrusive (light italic type), but the `#>`
out comments should be legible (darker roman type).

To treat these two type of comments differently, I modified the [R syntax definition][syntax] used by pandoc to
recognize `#` and `#>` as different entities. We can pass that syntax
definition to pandoc:

[syntax]: https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/blob/master/data/syntax/r.xml "GitHub page for the r.xml syntax definition"

```{r shot3, fig.cap = "Screenshot of html file created by pandoc. It now has solarized colors and differently styled #> comments."}
syntax_sl <- solarizeddocx::file_syntax_definition()
results <- run_pandoc(
  md_file, 
  pd_style(theme_sl), 
  pd_syntax(syntax_sl)
)
page_thumbnail(results, "shot3.png")
```

## Creating a theme from scratch

Maybe you're thinking, *that's cool... if you like solarized. What about
something fun like Fairy Floss?* Okay, fine, let's make [Fairy
Floss](https://github.com/sailorhg/fairyfloss)... right now... in this
blog post.

First, let's store the Fairy Floss colors in a handy list:

```{r}
ff_colors <- list(
  gold = "#e6c000",
  yellow = "#ffea00",
  dark_purple = "#5a5475",
  white = "#f8f8f2",
  pink = "#ffb8d1",
  salmon = "#ff857f",
  purple = "#c5a3ff",
  teal = "#c2ffdf"
)
```

If we use the correct command, pandoc will provide us with a syntax
highlighting theme as a JSON file. `copy_base_pandoc_theme()` will call
this command for us. We can read that file into R and see that it is a list
of global style options followed by a list of individual style
definitions.

```{r}
temptheme <- tempfile(fileext = ".theme") 
solarizeddocx::copy_base_pandoc_theme(temptheme)

data_theme <- jsonlite::read_json(temptheme)
str(data_theme, max.level = 2)
```

Each of those individual style definitions is a list of color options
and font style options:

```{r}
str(data_theme$`text-styles`$Comment)
```

solarizeddocx provides a helper function `set_theme_text_style()` for
setting individual style options. Let's set up Fairy Floss's global and
comment styles. We use the fake name `"global"` to access the global
style options, and we use style definition names like `"Comment"` to access
those specifically. 

```{r}
library(magrittr)
ff_theme <- data_theme %>% 
  solarizeddocx::set_theme_text_style(
    "global", 
    background = ff_colors$dark_purple,
    text = ff_colors$white
  ) %>% 
  solarizeddocx::set_theme_text_style(
    "Comment",
    text = ff_colors$gold
  ) %>% 
  solarizeddocx::set_theme_text_style(
    "String",
    text = ff_colors$yellow 
  )
```

Let's preview our partial theme:

```{r shot4, fig.cap = "Screenshot of html file created by pandoc. It has a purple background, white text, gold comments and yellow strings, but it still looks bad because not all of the colors are done."}
solarizeddocx::write_pandoc_theme(ff_theme, temptheme)
results <- run_pandoc(
  md_file, 
  pd_style(temptheme), 
  pd_syntax(syntax_sl)
)
page_thumbnail(results, "shot4.png")
```

This is a good start, but when I first ported the solarized theme, I had
to use 20 calls to `set_theme_text_style()`. That's a lot. Plus, **themes
are data**. Can't we just describe what needs to change in a list? Yes.
For this post, I made `solarizeddocx::patch_theme_text_style()` where we
describe the changes to make as a list of patches.

Let's write our list of patches to make to the base theme. Because some
style definitions are identical, we will use tibble's lazy list
[`tibble::lst()`](`r a_lst`)to reuse patches along the way. For this application of the palette, I consulted the [Fairy Floss .tmTheme file][fftm] and the [rsthemes implementation][ffrs] of Fairy Floss.

[fftm]: http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/url/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sailorhg/fairyfloss/gh-pages/fairyfloss.tmTheme "Fairy Floss Theme in online editor"

[ffrs]: https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes/blob/main/inst/templates/fairyfloss.scss#L31-L42 "GitHub source for  rsthemes/inst/templates/fairyfloss.scss"

```{r}
patches <- tibble::lst(
  global = list(
    text = ff_colors$white,
    background = ff_colors$dark_purple
  ),
  # # comments
  Comment = list(text = ff_colors$gold, italic = TRUE, bold = FALSE),
  # ## comments
  Documentation = Comment,
  # #> comments
  Information = list(text = ff_colors$gold, italic = FALSE, bold = TRUE),
  Keyword = list(text = ff_colors$pink),
  ControlFlow = list(text = ff_colors$pink, bold = FALSE),
  Operator = list(text = ff_colors$pink),
  Function = list(text = ff_colors$teal),
  Attribute = list(text = ff_colors$white),
  Variable = list(text = ff_colors$white),
  # this should be code outside of a code block
  VerbatimString = list(
    text = ff_colors$white, 
    background = ff_colors$dark_purple
  ),
  Other = Variable,
  Constant = list(text = ff_colors$purple),
  Error = list(text = ff_colors$salmon),
  Alert = Error,
  Warning = Error,
  Float = list(text = ff_colors$purple),
  DecVal = Float,
  BaseN = Float,
  SpecialChar = list(text = ff_colors$white),
  String = list(text = ff_colors$yellow),
  Char = String,
  SpecialString = String
)
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class = "notice--info">
**Save yourself from guessing and checking.** These style definition
names are documented on [this
page](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/highlight.html#kate-highlight-default-styles).
I wish I had found this page before starting to port the solarized
theme. My initial approach was to use the style inspector in Microsoft
Word and look at the style names applied to pieces of code. The downside
of that approach is that in order to figure out what a `SpecialChar`
was, I had to write a `SpecialChar`. (Escape sequences inside of strings
like `"hello\nthere"` are `SpecialChars` in the R syntax definition used
by pandoc.)
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}


Now we apply our patches to the theme:

```{r shot5, fig.cap = "Screenshot of html file created by pandoc. It now has Fairy Floss colors."}
ff_theme <- solarizeddocx::patch_theme_text_style(
  data_theme,
  patches
)

solarizeddocx::write_pandoc_theme(ff_theme, temptheme)
results <- run_pandoc(
  md_file, 
  pd_style(temptheme), 
  pd_syntax(syntax_sl)
)
page_thumbnail(results, "shot5.png")
```

Wonderful!

## Sneaking these features into RMarkdown

So far, we have set these options by directly calling pandoc with the style
and syntax options. We can use these options in RMarkdown *some of the time*.
For example, here we try to send the Fairy Floss theme into an 
[`html_document()`](`r a_html_document`) and fail.

```{r shot6, fig.cap = "Screenshot of html file created by RMarkdown. It has the default colors."}
out <- rmarkdown::render(
  md_file, 
  output_format = rmarkdown::html_document(
    pandoc_args = c(pd_style(temptheme), pd_syntax(syntax_sl))
  ),
  quiet = TRUE
)
page_thumbnail(out, "shot6.png")
```

RMarkdown assembles and performs a giant pandoc command. The problem, as
far as I can tell, is that this command includes our
`pd_style(temptheme)` which sets the option for
`--highlight-style`---but later on it also includes `--no-highlight`
which blocks our style. Bummer.

If we use the simpler [`html_document_base()`](`r a_html_document_base`)
format, however, we can see Fairy Floss output.

```{r shot7, fig.cap = "Screenshot of html file created by RMarkdown. It has the Fairy Floss colors."}
out <- rmarkdown::render(
  md_file, 
  output_format = rmarkdown::html_document_base(
    pandoc_args = c(pd_style(temptheme), pd_syntax(syntax_sl))
  ),
  quiet = TRUE
)
page_thumbnail(out, "shot7.png")
```

The options also work for the [`pdf_document()`](`r a_pdf_document`) format.

```{r shot8, fig.cap = "Screenshot of a cropped pdf file created by RMarkdown. It has the Fairy Floss colors."}
out <- rmarkdown::render(
  md_file, 
  output_format = rmarkdown::pdf_document(
    pandoc_args = c(pd_style(temptheme), pd_syntax(syntax_sl))
  ), 
  quiet = TRUE
)

# Convert to png and crop most of the empty page
png <- pdftools::pdf_convert(out, dpi = 144)
magick::image_read(png) %>% 
  magick::image_crop(magick::geometry_area(1050, 400, 100, 100))
```

The options also work with [`word_document()`](`r a_word_document`). In fact, that's how 
`solarizeddocx::document()` works.




```{r, include = FALSE}
.parent_doc <- knitr::current_input()
```
```{r, child = "_R/_footer.Rmd"}
```
