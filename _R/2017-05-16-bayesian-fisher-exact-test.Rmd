A few days ago, I watched a [terrific lecture by Bob
Carpenter][bc-youtube] on Bayesian models. He started with a Bayesian
approach to Fisher's exact test. I had never heard of this classical
procedure, so I was curious to play with the example. In this post, I
use the same data that he used in the lecture and in an earlier,
[pre-Stan blog post][bc-blog]. I show how I would go about fitting
the model in Stan and inspecting the results in R.

## Problem statement

We observed the following data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_version)
```

Question: Is the rate of left-handedness different between the male and
female groups? Specifically, is left-handedness more likely in the male
group?


### Classical approach

In frequentist statistics, we might run Fisher's exact test. At least,
that's what the [flow charts][flow-charts] tell us. To do that, we
first put the data in a matrix.

```{r}
# Create a matrix representation of the data for the fisher test
m <- matrix(
  c(9, 43, 4, 44), 
  nrow = 2, 
  byrow = TRUE,
  dimnames = list(
    sex = c("male", "female"), 
    handedness = c("left", "right"))
  )
m
```

We can run the two-tailed test: Are the two groups different?

```{r}
fisher.test(m)
```

The output is a little verbose, but I do like how it spells out a
sentence describing the alternative hypothesis.

We can also consider one-sided test: Is left-handedness greater in the
male group?

```{r}
fisher.test(m, alternative = "greater")
```

In both tests, we cannot reject the null hypothesis because the
*p*-value is greater than .05 ❌, so we would conclude that the two
groups are not different.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
glm <- glm(
  cbind(`n left handed`, `n right handed`) ~ sex, 
  family = binomial, 
  data = df_version
)
summary(glm)
```

But I don't really know this test that well. We never covered it in any
of my stats classes, and indeed, this post is the first time I ever used
the function `fisher.test()`. If I had never heard of the test, I am not
quite sure what I would have done. Maybe a logistic regression (*p* =
.191 ❌).


## Creating a Stan model

I'm very not fluent in the classical bag of tricks, but that's okay. I
know some Stan, I have an idea about how the data could have been
generated, and that's good enough ☺️. I can just write down my
data-generating story in a model and let Stan compute a posterior
distribution for the difference in handedness rates between the two
groups.

For my model, I'm going to suppose that in each group, there is a
probability of being left-handed called *θ* and that the counts we see
result from a binomial process. The 9 left-handed males we observe are
the number of successes from 52 observations of a process that
"succeeds" with probability *θ*<sub>male</sub>.

To fit the model, we need a prior distribution. The prior's job is to
generate possible *θ*'s, and we will use our data to update the prior.
The Beta distribution generates values between 0 and 1, so it's an
obvious choice.

In math, the model for a group would be:

$$
\begin{align*}
   n_\text{left-handed in group} &\sim \text{Binomial}(n_\text{total in group}, \theta_\text{group}) &\text{[likelihood]}\\
   \theta_\text{group} &\sim \text{Beta}(a, b) &\text{[prior prob. of left-handedness]}\\
   a, b &: \text{shape terms for prior}
\end{align*}
$$

We can use a flat, uninformative prior by using *a* = 1, *b* = 1. This
prior considers all probabilities from 0 to 1 as equally plausible.

```{r flat, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2, fig.asp = NULL, fig.cap = "Density plot of the flat, uninformative prior."}
library(ggplot2)
steps <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .01)

ggplot(data.frame(x = steps, y = dbeta(steps, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1))) + 
  geom_line(aes(x, y)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = (0:10) / 10) + 
  ylim(0, 2) +
  labs(x = "p(left-handed)", y = "density", title = "beta(1,1)")
```

But I also think that 10-ish% of people are left handed. (I don't know
where I first heard this number, but it'll serve as my prior
information.) I toyed around with `shape1` and `shape2` parameters in
`dbeta()` until I got the prior Beta(5, 40), which is peaked around
.1-ish but wide enough to keep .5 and .15 as plausible values too.

```{r informative, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2, fig.asp = NULL, , fig.cap = "Density plot of the informative prior."}
ggplot(data.frame(x = steps, y = dbeta(steps, shape1 = 5, shape2 = 40))) + 
  geom_line(aes(x, y)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = (0:10) / 10) +
  labs(x = "p(left-handed)", y = "density", title = "beta(5,40)")
```

Let's write out a really simple model in Stan. Okay, it *used to* be
really simple. Then I made the parameters for the Beta prior data
values, and then I created an option to just sample the prior
distribution. But the core of it is simple. The most important lines are
the one with `~` symbols. These correspond to the sampling statements in
the mathematical description of the model.

```{r model_code, cache = TRUE}
model_code <- "
data {
  int<lower=0> beta_a;
  int<lower=0> beta_b;
  int<lower=0> n_total_1;
  int<lower=0> n_total_2;
  int<lower=0> n_hits_1;
  int<lower=0> n_hits_2;
  int<lower=0, upper=1> sample_prior_only;
}
parameters { 
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta_1;
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta_2;
}
model {
  theta_1 ~ beta(beta_a, beta_b);
  theta_2 ~ beta(beta_a, beta_b);
  
  if (sample_prior_only != 1) {
    n_hits_1 ~ binomial(n_total_1, theta_1);
    n_hits_2 ~ binomial(n_total_2, theta_2);
  }
}
generated quantities {
  real diff;
  diff = theta_1 - theta_2;
}
"
```

The `generated quantities` block runs on every sample of the posterior
distribution. Here, we compute the *θ*<sub>male</sub> −
*θ*<sub>female</sub> on every draw. Computing the difference inside the
model code means that Stan will treat the `diff` values like any other
parameter of the model. It will show up in summary functions and in
plots of model parameters. That saves us some work later on.

**Update: Migrated to cmdstanr**. This post was originally written
in 2017 and used the [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/) interface to
compile Stan models from R. I have updated this post to use the
[cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) interface instead. I have kept
around the original rstan code in place, albeit commented out.

</div>


```{r}
# # 2017 rstan-based version  
# library(rstan)

# 2022 cmdstanr version
library(cmdstanr)
```

I begin by compiling the model. This step will create an executable
program that can sample from the model. I do the compilation in its own
step so that I can re-use the program for different versions of the
model.

```{r model_program, results = 'hide'}
# # 2017 rstan-based version  
# model_program <- stan_model(model_code = model_code)

# 2022 cmdstanr version
file <- write_stan_file(model_code, dir = "_caches", basename = "bfet")
model_program <- cmdstan_model(file)
```

For convenience, I wrote a function that fits different versions of this
model. This step is not necessary, but I don't like repeating myself.
(Normally, you would use `sampling(model_program, stan_data)` with rstan or
`model_program$sample(stan_data)` with cmdstanr to get samples from a
model-program.)

```{r}
run_model <- function(beta_a, beta_b, sample_prior_only) {
  stan_data <- list(
    beta_a = beta_a,
    beta_b = beta_b,
    n_total_1 = 9 + 43,
    n_total_2 = 4 + 44,
    n_hits_1 = 9,
    n_hits_2 = 4,
    sample_prior_only = sample_prior_only
  )

  # # 2017 rstan-based version  
  # 
  # # Use quietly() to hide the sampler's output text
  # # model <- purrr::quietly(sampling)(model_program, stan_data)
  # model <- purrr::quietly(sampling)(model_program, stan_data)
  # 
  # # But print any warnings that would have appeared
  # invisible(lapply(model$warnings, warning, call. = FALSE))
  # 
  # model$result
  
  # 2022 cmdstanr version
  model <- model_program$sample(data = stan_data, refresh = 0)
  model
}
```

The actual left-handed versus right-handed numbers are hard-coded, but I
can adjust the parameters for the Beta prior and toggle between sampling
from the prior and the posterior. ~~Stan normally prints out verbose
progress information but I suppress that by using `purrr::quietly()`. I
still want warnings, so I print them if they arise.~~

### Checking our prior information

Now, let's draw samples from the priors of each model. This step lets us
check that our program works as expected. We know how the values should
be distributed---we made up the numbers!

```{r}
m_informative_pd <- run_model(beta_a = 5, beta_b = 40, sample_prior_only = 1)
m_informative_pd

m_flat_pd <- run_model(beta_a = 1, beta_b = 1, sample_prior_only = 1)
m_flat_pd
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
as_percent <- function(x) paste0(x * 100, "%")

# # 2017 rstan-based version
# df_flat_pd <- as.data.frame(m_flat_pd)
# df_informative_pd <- as.data.frame(m_informative_pd)

# 2022 cmdstanr version
df_flat_pd <- posterior::as_draws_df(m_flat_pd)
df_informative_pd <- posterior::as_draws_df(m_informative_pd)

i_cred <- round(quantile(df_informative_pd$theta_1, c(.025, .975)), 2)
d_med <- round(quantile(df_informative_pd$diff, c(.5)), 2)
```

We can confirm (by inspecting the `diff` row) that the difference in
left-handedness in both groups is `r d_med` according to our priors. The
informative prior says that the values between `r i_cred[1]` and
`r i_cred[2]` are plausible rates of left-handedness in each group.

It's worth a moment to reflect on how obviously wrong the uninformative
prior is. The central *θ* value in each group is .5. Therefore, half of
the prior samples assert that there are more left-handed individuals
than right-handed ones! If there is anything we know about handedness,
it's that left-handedness is less common than right-handedness.
*Uninformative* sometimes connotes "unbiased" or "letting the data speak
for itself", but in this case, I would say "gullible".

## Sampling the posterior

Now, the fun part. We update our prior information with our data. 

```{r}
m_informative <- run_model(beta_a = 5, beta_b = 40, sample_prior_only = 0)
m_informative

m_flat <- run_model(beta_a = 1, beta_b = 1, sample_prior_only = 0)
m_flat
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# # 2017 rstan-based version
# df_flat <- as.data.frame(m_flat)
# df_informative <- as.data.frame(m_informative)

# 2022 cmdstanr version
df_flat <- posterior::as_draws_df(m_flat)
df_informative <- posterior::as_draws_df(m_informative)

q_flat <- round(quantile(df_flat$diff, c(.05, .5, .95)), 2)
q_info <- round(quantile(df_informative$diff, c(.05, .5, .95)), 2)

flat_diff <- median(df_flat$diff) %>% round(2)
median(df_informative$diff)
```

The flat model puts the difference at `r q_flat[2]` and 90% of the
plausible values fall in the interval [`r q_flat[1]`, `r q_flat[3]`].
The informative model is more skeptical of higher left-handedness rates,
so it puts the difference at `r q_info[2]` with 90% of the values
between [`r q_info[1]`, `r q_info[3]`]. Both of these intervals
contain 0 and negative values ❌, so there is not much evidence for
higher left-handedness in the male group.

To compute a "Bayesian *p*-value", we could ask what proportion of
differences are 0 or negative. There are more proper ways to make this
inference in a Bayesian framework, but this approach is the easiest and
it works for a model this simple. If 10% of the plausible values for the
group differences are negative, then we assign a 10% probability to a
negative group difference.

```{r}
mean(df_flat$diff <= 0)

mean(df_informative$diff <= 0)
```

It's also worth comparing the two models. I've recently become a fan of
the [ggmcmc package](http://xavier-fim.net/packages/ggmcmc/) for quick
visualization of Stan models. The package uses a function `ggs()` to
create a long dataframe of MCMC samples. Then you plug those dataframes
into various plotting functions that start with `ggs_`. I especially
like how the package returns a plain ggplot2 plot that I can easily
adjust with a few extra lines of code.

For example, not much effort is required---after some practice and
trial-and-error, of course---to visualize the posterior samples in each
model.

```{r ggmcmc-density, warning = FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 6, fig.asp = NULL, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", fig.cap = "Density plot of the MCMC samples for the parameters in each model."}
library(ggmcmc)

# A helper dataframe for relabeling parameters. I'm writing them in a way that
# works with ?plotmath conventions.
labels <- data.frame(
  Parameter = c("theta_1", "theta_2", "diff"), 
  Label = c("theta[male]", "theta[female]", "theta[male] - theta[female]")
)

# # 2017 rstan-based version
# a <- m_flat
# b <- m_informative

# 2022 cmdstanr version
a <- as_mcmc.list(m_flat)
b <- as_mcmc.list(m_informative)

# Get ggmcmc's tidy dataframe of each model.
# ggs() doesn't like that labels I made have brackets so I am suppressing its
# warnings.
ggs_flat <- suppressWarnings(
  ggs(a, description = "flat", par_labels = labels)
)
ggs_informative <- suppressWarnings(
  ggs(b, description = "informative", par_labels = labels)
)

# Remove log-posterior density if it sneaks in
ggs_flat <- ggs_flat[ggs_flat$Parameter != "lp__", ]
ggs_informative <- ggs_informative[ggs_informative$Parameter != "lp__", ]

ggs_density(ggs_flat) + 
  facet_grid(Parameter ~ ., labeller = label_parsed) + 
  ggtitle("flat prior: beta(1, 1)") + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 14) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
  # so the two models can be compared
  xlim(-.2, .5)

ggs_density(ggs_informative) + 
  facet_grid(Parameter ~ ., labeller = label_parsed) + 
  ggtitle("informative prior: beta(5, 40)") + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 14) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
  # so the two models can be compared
  xlim(-.2, .5)
```



We can also compare the models together in a single plot by passing a
list of model dataframes into `ggs_caterpillar()`.

```{r ggmcmc-caterpillar, fig.cap = "Caterpillar plot of the MCMC samples for the parameters in each model."}
ggs_caterpillar(
  D = list(ggs_flat, ggs_informative), 
  line = 0,
  thick_ci = c(0.05, 0.95), 
  thin_ci = c(0.025, 0.975)
) +
  # Parse the labels as formatted math
  scale_y_discrete(
    breaks = as.character(unique(ggs_flat$Parameter)),
    labels = parse(text = as.character(unique(ggs_flat$Parameter)))
  ) +
  labs(
    caption = "Intervals: thick 90%, thin 95%. Point: median.", 
    y = NULL, 
    x = NULL
  ) + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 14)
```

There's a lot of useful information here. First, the intervals in the
flat prior model are wider than the ones for the informative model. The
two models largely agree on the values in the female group, although the
flat prior model is wider. These wider intervals indicate greater
uncertainty about the parameter values. The two models disagree on the
male group, because the informative model assigns little prior
probability to values greater than .25 but the flat model doesn't
discount those possibilities.

The models also demonstrate the **regularizing effect of prior
information**. Regularization broadly refers to techniques to avoid
overfitting a dataset. Priors can regularize a model by making it
skeptical of certain parameter values---in this case, high values of
left-handedness. The male probabilities in the flat model are basically
pulled towards the values in the informative prior (.1-ish). We can see
this effect in how the midpoint is shifted in the flat model versus the
informative model.


***

I would be remiss if I didn't end with the following disclaimer/trivia.
In a way, the question behind this post is ill-posed because handedness
is not quite a binary measure. Some years ago, I had a class on
stuttering and fluency disorders. (I used to be a speech pathologist.)
There once was a lot of research on the association between handedness
and stuttering, and at some point, researchers figured out that they
could measure handedness as a continuous measure. They gave people a
survey asking which hands they use for certain tasks and then computed a
so-called [dextrality quotient][dq] from the responses. I had the
concept driven home when I once saw my wife casually switch between her
left and right hands while brushing her teeth. I would probably poke a
hole through my cheek if I used my left hand! So: Handedness may be a
matter of degree. (Or maybe not. I mostly wanted to mention the
dextrality quotient. It's fun to think about.)
