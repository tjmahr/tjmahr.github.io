knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

A colleague of mine sent me the following R question:

> I have a function that takes a list and does some stuff to it and then returns
it. I then take that output and run it through the same function again. But I
obviously don't want to repeatedly type the function out, because I want the
number of function replications to be a declared argument. I had little luck
with [functionals](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html), although they 
seemed like an obvious choice.

It goes on to say that the solution should work in a magrittr pipeline, so that 
will influence how we solve the problem. Namely, we want to write a
function that will transform a pipeline like: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x %>% 
  some_function(args) %>% 
  some_function(args) %>% 
  some_function(args) %>% 
  some_function(args)
```

into a one-liner like

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x %>% 
  repeated(.reps = 4, some_function, args)
```


## Winding up a while loop

The solution is repeated function application with some book-keeping. We could
do this with a while-loop or even with recursion. Here's the loop version.

```{r}
repeated <- function(.x, .reps = 1, .f, ...) {
  # A single, finite, non-negative number of repetitions
  assertthat::assert_that(
    length(.reps) == 1,
    !is.na(.reps),
    .reps >= 0,
    is.finite(.reps))
  
  # accept purrr-style formula functions
  .f <- purrr::as_mapper(.f, ...)
  
  # 0 .reps
  value <- .x

  while (.reps >= 1) {
    value <- .f(value, ...)
    .reps <- .reps - 1
  }

  value
}
```

We start with some basic input-checking on the number of repetitions.
`assert_that()` is like `stopifnot()`, but it spells out failures a little more
verbosely. (To be honest, I don't like that about half of the function is for 
checking the number of repetitions, but that's how it goes...)

```{r, error = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(purrr)
add <- function(x, y) x + y

10 %>% repeated(-1, add, 2)
10 %>% repeated(1:10, add, 2)
```

The next line uses purrr's `as_function()`, so that we can also use 
formula-based anonymous functions. Here are examples with named functions, 
typical anonymous functions and formula-based anonymous functions.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Regular named function
1:4 %>% repeated(1, add, 2)
1:4 %>% repeated(5, add, 2)

# Conventional anonymous function
1:4 %>% repeated(2, function(x) x * 2)

# Formula-based anonymous function
1:4 %>% repeated(4, ~ .x * 2)

# A weird kind of power tower!
1:4 %>% repeated(4, ~ .x ^ 2)
((((1:4) ^ 2) ^ 2) ^ 2) ^ 2
```

Because we are working in a pipeline, we expect the first argument to be some
data. If we apply a function 0 times to the data, it should return the data.
That's why we set the `value` to the input before the loop.

```{r}
# 0 function-applications
1:4 %>% repeated(0, add, 2)
```

This function is built around a while-loop that ticks down every time the
function is applied. Generally, loops are not considered idiomatic R. I
certainly try to avoid writing loops in R because the language has built-in 
functions that can abstract over a lot of iteration and the required 
book-keeping. If we are iterating over a dimension of something, like
elements in a vector or columns in a data-frame, we can probably write a 
loop-free version. But here we are not looping over structure&mdash;we are looping
through time! This is fundamentally different kind of problem than the kinds
are that solved by `Map()` or `lapply()`. That's why we had to invent our own
higher-order function to handle this kind of iteration for us.


## Drilling down with recursion

![Google search for "recursion" says "Did you mean recursion?"](/assets/images/recursion.png)

But we can make it loop-free, by torturing the code into recursion. Okay, it's
not _that_ bad. Here I break it up into an input-handling step which sets the
stage for the recursive function `recursively_repeat()`.

```{r}
rrrepeated <- function(.x, .reps = 1, .f, ...) {
  # A single, finite, non-negative number of repetitions
  assertthat::assert_that(
    length(.reps) == 1,
    !is.na(.reps),
    .reps >= 0,
    is.finite(.reps))
  
  # accept purrr-style formula functions
  .f <- purrr::as_mapper(.f, ...)
  
  recursively_repeat(.x, .reps, .f, ...)
}

recursively_repeat <- function(.x, .reps, .f, ...) {
  if (.reps == 0) {
    .x
  } else { 
    recursively_repeat(.f(.x, ...), .reps - 1, .f, ...)
    # (It would be more correct to use `Recall()` so that renaming the function
    # doesn't break this line... -- how's that for an R deep cut?)
  }
}
```

This is classic recursion. There are two branches. In the _base case_, when
there are zero repetitions, the work is done and we return the input In the
_recursive case_, we re-apply the function, take away one of the repetitions
and then try the recursion again&mdash;and again and again until we bottom out
and hit the base case. 

This version works like its buddy:

```{r}
1:4 %>% repeated(5, ~ .x - 2)
1:4 %>% rrrepeated(5, ~ .x - 2)

echo <- function(x) paste0(x, " (", x, ")") 
"hello" %>% repeated(2, echo)
"hello" %>% rrrepeated(2, echo)
```

The main drawback to the recursive version is its readability. I just find it
harder to take in compared to the loop version&mdash;at least for a problem this
simple. For more interesting data structures, the recursive version may prove
more elegant and comprehensible.

A minor drawback to the recursive approach is its performance. It's a little
slower at the median level than the loop approach.

```{r}
shuffle <- function(x) sample(x)

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  with_while = repeated(1:100, 100, shuffle),
  with_recur = rrrepeated(1:100, 100, shuffle),
  times = 1000
)
```

But I don't usually worry about performance unless I can notice the computation
taking time. 

What I will always notice is R trying to protect me from infinite
recursion when I crank up the number of repetitions:

```{r, error = TRUE}
repeated(1:20, 1000, shuffle)
rrrepeated(1:20, 1000, shuffle)
```

***

To recap, we had a problem that centered around a specific kind of iteration:
repeatedly applying function on an input. To solve the problem, I wrote a
higher-order function to handle this kind of iteration. My first pass at the
problem used a simple while loop that ticked down a counter every time the
function was called. Dared by the loop-free purism, I also wrote a recursive
version, but for a problem this simple, it's more of a curiosity.

**Update: Trampolines?** Thanks to RStudio's community forum, I've learned that
there is a "trampoline" programming pattern for converting
recursive functions into ones that use loops. Read the [great thread
