A videogame speedrun is a challenge to beat the game as quickly as
possible. It's time attack racing but for a videogame. There are, in my
mind, two ways to make a run's time go faster: Playing better and more
smoothly (optimizations, having better luck) and playing less of the
game (better routing, new glitches/skips). The history of a speedrun
category then is often an exciting mix of evolutionary improvements as
players level up their skills and revolutionary jumps as players find
new ways to cut through the game.

[Summoning Salt](https://www.youtube.com/c/SummoningSalt) is a Youtube
creator who creates documentaries that trace out the world record
progression in a speedrun. The videos are immensely enjoyable, as Salt
dishes out the history bit by bit, record by record, sometimes in a suspenseful fashion. 

As a data visualization person, I've noticed that Summoning
Salt recently started to use a new prop in the videos: A step graph of the
world record times. The graph is developed throughout a video as players 
(represented by individual colors) lower the times with new
records (points) until you get a full reveal of a timeline like the
following:


{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2022-05-wr-plot-1.png" alt="Screenshot of a timeline from a Summoning Salt video." caption = "Screenshot of a timeline from a Summoning Salt video." %}{: style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 2em auto;"}

Let's recreate this figure in R with ggplot2.


## Warp pipe: Obtaining the data

The game in question is *New Super Mario Bros Wii*, and the record
keeper is the site [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/nsmbw). There
is not just one speedrun category for this game, so in particular, we
want the "Any%" record history (i.e., "any percent": you don't have
play every level, and you can skip parts of the game.)

We need to get the leaderboard history data from speedrun.com. There is an
[official REST API](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api) for the
site's data, but it's not straightforward how to query it to obtain the
data needed for a world record progression. (Apparently, one could
request [the leaderboard on different
dates](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api/issues/123) and work
backwards through time.) But that's okay, we are not going to use the
API. Instead, the [statistics page for the
game](https://www.speedrun.com/nsmbw/gamestats) has a plot that is
tantalizingly close to the one we want to create.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2022-05-wr-plot-2.png" alt="A timeline figure from speedrun.com." caption = "A timeline figure from speedrun.com." %}{: style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 2em auto;"}


This plot is *interactive*, and our browser is downloading the data and
plotting it for us. If we snoop around the page, we can find the JSON
data behind the plot. In Firefox, when I right-click on the plot and hit
"Inspect", I see the HTML code that contains the plot. Just below the
plot's div is a chunk of Javascript.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2022-05-firefox-shot2.png" alt="A screenshot of the Firefox inspector showing the speedrun data in a Javascript script tag." caption = "A screenshot of the Firefox inspector showing the speedrun data in a Javascript script tag." %}{: style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 2em auto;"}



The first line of it is all the speedrun data that is being plotted. We
save that JSON into [its own file](https://github.com/tjmahr/tjmahr.github.io/blob/master/_R/data/2022-05-23-nsmbw-runs.json). 




## Ground pound: Filtering and cleaning the data

Let's read the data into R. JSON is short for "Javascript Object
Notation", and it's basically the equivalent of a `list()` in R. Hence,
[jsonlite](`r a_readjson`) provides a large, deeply nested list for us.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# a helper function to download the data from github
# in case you want to play along
path_blog_data <- function(x) {
  file.path(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com",
    "tjmahr/tjmahr.github.io/master/_R/data",
    x
  )
}

json_runs <- path_blog_data("2022-05-23-nsmbw-runs.json") |> 
  jsonlite::read_json()
```

The plot on the statistics page has a dropdown menu for different
kinds of records to display, so this JSON object has a sublist for each
dropdown menu choice. What we want is the first sublist (full game runs)
then its first sublist (with a `label` of `"Any% - Physical"`) then its
`"data"`. 

```{r}
# Dropdown menu choices
str(json_runs, max.level = 1)

# Full game run histories
str(json_runs[[1]], max.level = 2)

# Just want the data field from the first one
json_any_percent <- json_runs[[1]][[1]][["data"]]
```

Here are the first two points' worth of date. We have a not-so-obviously
encoded date (`x`), the run length in seconds (`y`) and the `player`. We
are going to convert each of these lists into a dataframe and bind them
together.

```{r}
json_any_percent |> head(2) |> str()

data <- json_any_percent |> 
  lapply(
    # turn one list into a dataframe
    function(x) { 
      tibble(
        date = x$x, 
        run_time_s = x$y, 
        player = x$players[[1]]
      )
    }
  ) |> 
  bind_rows()

data
```

Lastly, we need to do something about those dates. When you see a
date-time represented by a single large number, it's probably a
[POSIX](`r a_posix`) date representing the date-time as the number of
seconds since some origin date-time (see also [Unix
Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)). Using the default Unix
origin time seems to give the correct date conversion:

```{r}
data <- data |> 
  mutate(
    date_posix = as.POSIXct(date, tz = "UTC", origin = "1970-01-01")
  ) 

data
```

## Triple jump: Plotting

First, let's get the data on the panel. I could spend an endless amount
of time tweaking or customizing a plot's theme, so I do the styling
last. Otherwise, styling would fill up all of the time I've set aside to
work on the plot.

We want to draw a point for each particular record-setting event, and we
want to draw a line that connects all of the points.
[`geom_step()`](`r a_geom_step`) draws a line plot but it can move
straight up/down or straight left/right---no diagonal lines---so it's
what we want. We also want to the color of these geometries to change
with the record holder (`player`).

```{r plot-oops, fig.cap = "A step plot with one line per player. It is not what we want."}
ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date_posix, y = run_time_s, color = player) + 
  geom_step() +
  geom_point()
```

Oops! It assumed that we wanted to connected the dots separately for
each color. We have to set the `group` aesthetic to a constant value so
there is only one line drawn.

```{r plot-grouped-correctly, fig.cap = "A step plot showing the world record progression. There is a single line and it changes color whenever a new record-holder takes over."}
ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date_posix, y = run_time_s, color = player) + 
  geom_step(aes(group = 1)) +
  geom_point()
```

Making the Summoning Salt version is just a matter of theming at this
point. We use [`theme_void()`](`r a_theme_void`) to completely wipe out
the current theme, and we hide the color legend.

```{r void-plot-1, fig.cap = "A step plot showing the world record progression."}
ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date_posix, y = run_time_s, color = player) + 
  geom_step(aes(group = 1)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_void() +
  guides(color = "none")
```

Next, we are going to use the showtext package to obtain an 8-bit font:

```{r}
library(showtext)
font_add_google("Press Start 2P")
showtext_auto(TRUE)
```

The void theme provides nothing, so we have to specify the main colors,
the axis lines, and the plotting margin. We also crank up the chroma
values to have more intense colors for the black background.

```{r void-plot-2, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2, fig.cap = "A step plot showing the world record progression. There is a black background now and an 8-bit looking font."}
ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date_posix, y = run_time_s, color = player) + 
  geom_step(aes(group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  guides(color = "none") + 
  scale_color_discrete(c = 255) +
  labs(title = "World Record Timeline") +
  theme_void(base_size = 20, base_family = "Press Start 2P") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = .5), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
    axis.line = element_line(
      color = "white", 
      size = 1, 
      # more 8-bit looking lines
      lineend = "square"
    ), 
    plot.margin = margin(12, 12, 12, 12, "pt")
  ) 
  
```

To keep overlapping points from looking like blobs, we can use a filled
point. For these, `color` is used on the border and `fill` is used on
the inside. We will set the outline of the points to black and the fill
to the player color. (If you look at more professional data
visualizations, you see this trick frequently with white bordering
around points.) With a new fill aesthetic in place, e have to make sure
that guide for the fill doesn't appear and that fill and color have the
same color scale.


```{r void-plot-3, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2, fig.cap = "A step plot showing the world record progression. The points have been restyled to have a black outline."}
ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date_posix, y = run_time_s, color = player) + 
  geom_step(aes(group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(
    aes(fill = player),
    shape = 21,
    color = "black", 
    size = 2
  ) +
  # no legend for fill
  guides(color = "none", fill = "none") + 
  # fill and color get same scale
  scale_color_discrete(c = 255, aesthetics = c("color", "fill")) +
  labs(title = "World Record Timeline") +
  theme_void(base_size = 20, base_family = "Press Start 2P") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = .5), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
    axis.line = element_line(
      color = "white", 
      size = 1, 
      lineend = "square"
    ), 
    plot.margin = margin(12, 12, 12, 12, "pt")
  ) 
```



Finally, let's make another version of this figure. How might we make a
more accessible presentation of this information (of who held a record
and when), assuming that we only have a static image? A legend with
players/colors is a nonstarter. We could give each player their own
distinct point shape so that color/shape encode the same information,
but shapes get rough once you have to use more than four of them. We
could use a player's first letter instead of a point (show an F for
FadeVanity) but the letters quickly overlap.

One idea would be to label the point with an annotation whenever there
is a new record holder. 

```{r informative-plot, fig.width = 6.5, fig.cap = "A step plot showing the world record progression. The name of the player is next to their point whenever the record changes."}
showtext_auto(FALSE)
data <- data |>
  mutate(
    # Remove the country flag annotation from this player
    player2 = ifelse(
      player == "[gb/eng]FadeVanity", 
      "FadeVanity", 
      player
    ),
    # Record whenever the title holder changes as an "era"
    change = player != lag(player) | is.na(lag(player)),
    era = cumsum(change)
  ) 

# I am going to hardcode some vertical position adjustments for the labels.
offsets <- c(1, 2, 1, 5, -1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, -4, -3, -2, -1)

data_lab <- data |> 
  group_by(era) |> 
  # Label the last point in an era
  filter(run_time_s == max(run_time_s)) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  mutate(offset = offsets)

nudge_factor <- 30
ggplot(data) + 
  aes(x = date_posix, y = run_time_s, color = player) + 
  geom_text(
    aes(
      label = player2,
      y = run_time_s + nudge_factor * offset 
    ),
    hjust = 0,
    size = 4,
    data = data_lab
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      # i.e., run the line up to .95 of the label's nudging
      yend = run_time_s + nudge_factor * offset * .95, 
      xend = date_posix
    ),     
    data = data_lab, 
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) + 
  geom_step(aes(group = 1), size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  # yes, I'm adding forty million seconds to the last datetime
  expand_limits(x = max(data$date_posix) + 4e7) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  scale_x_datetime(
    name = NULL,
    date_breaks = "2 years", 
    date_labels = "%Y"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "World record",
    breaks = 21:27 * 60,
    # Show the minutes value with zero-padded seconds
    labels = function(x) sprintf("%d:%02.f", x %/% 60, x %% 60)
  ) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(12, 12, 12, 12, "pt"))
